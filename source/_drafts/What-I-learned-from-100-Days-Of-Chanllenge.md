I have four challenges. 

* [100 Days Of Code: Web Development](../100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1/)
* [100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R](../100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1)
* [100 Days Of Japanese](../100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1/)
* [100 Days Of Reading Paper](../100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1)

[100 Days Of Code: Web Development](../100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1/) is the most enjoyable one. The key factor is that I don't feel isolated when I have questions about projects.

 
The level of help I can get from high to low is Web Develpment > Data Analysis > Reading Paper 

The joy generated has the same order. 

There is no need to connect with others for "100 Days Of Japanese".

All pictures are from my own 100 Days challenge. **All points** listed in the article are used by myself from the beginning of the chanllenge to the end.

## Make additional rules for yourself

```
I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp ` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking websiteI will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp ` challenge on Twitter.

```

Coding community is very active. There are lots of peers who are conducting 100 Days challenge at the same time. I prevent myself from indulge in social media, such as, Twitter by limiting the number of twitts I will read each day. 

Building your own rule for your own weakness.

## Make a plan for tomorrow after completing today's coding session

My brain is down and it is 12 o'clock. I want to start coding write away. Not spending on figure out what I have done and what to do next.

After completing today's coding session, our brain will automatically list what more things can be done. Write them down! It will save the brain power tomorrow.

Next day, If I finish all items in the list, happiness will be generated. 

If I don't complete all of them, there is a record of what I have done and it is easy to move uncompleted items to next day's plan.

## Limit time spent working on projects if you are workholic

When I start doing projects, I tend to do it for several hours straight. All other parts of my life are interfered and I am easily burned out. It is dangerous. 

If you are workholic, please set a rule how much time spent on projects each day.

I know that is my weakness. The limit is a little bit over one hour. Even though no much progress is made each day, accumulatively it is big and I will not burn out because of long working hour.

## set milestone

I use the number of days as milestone. There is one section in the log devoted to record of milestone.

Here is an example:

* 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-06 Wednesday)
* 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-12 Monday)
* 30 Days
* 60 Days
* 90 Days
* 100 Days

I feel satisfied and happy to see what I have achieved.

## Get your domain and assign projects a subdomain

It is easy to put projects in codepen after finishing them. But they are not a working website that you can show them to other professionals or place them in the resume. 

You have to own a personal domain and give each project a subdomain or a new top domain.

You can buy the domain in GoDaddy or Namecheap (aff link). 

Here is the tutorial how to host projects in GitHub and give them a subdomain. After multiple practice, you can finish this procedure within minutes.

## Update the portfolio page frequently

When you start a new freecodecamp project, please add it to the portfolio page. You can give it a badge "Ongoing".

After competing the project, you can change the status from "Ongoing" to "Completed".

During the study period in freecodecamp, you will develop the habit to add/update projects to your fantastic portfolio if you can do it frequently. It also inspire you to prove the portfolio website.

There are many project portfolio in the forum of freecodecamp.  They are awsome. But they stop updating. 

You have spent so many hours in building your legendary portfolio page. Why do you waste it by stopping using it? 


## Create a post to record each day

I have a blog which I rarely used for three years. After beginning writing what have been done every toward the challenge, I am using it everyday. It will be impressive if you have a record of 100 days. 

In addition, I added them in the project list on the portfolio page even though none of personal websites I have seen include them as projects. It is optional.
