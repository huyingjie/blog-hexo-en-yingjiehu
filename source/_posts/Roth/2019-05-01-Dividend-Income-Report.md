## Dividend Income: $12.32
Stock|Cost/Share|Div/Share|	Share|Cost|2019 Dividend|2018 Dividend|YoY|Forward Dividend Rate
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
VMMXX|$\$$1	|$\$$0.00201|8,114|$\$$8,114	|	$\$$12.32|$\$$23.34|-47.22%|2.4%


Last year, much money was used to set limit buy orders. However, the orders were never executed. Hence, Vanguard automatical put the unused money in the VMMXX and generated monthly dividends. Purchases of stocks of BILI and DBX were made and little money was left in the money market. It led to less dividend in 2019.

I sold all VTIVX shares. The money was automatically in the money market. Hence, the dividend of VTIVX this month increased.

## Goal Review: 30% Completion

Goal for 2019: Earn $\$$343 in dividend income

## Capital Gain: $1,359.78

This is the the first month to earn more than $\$$1,000 a month for capital gain. It is amazing.

Most of earnings are from BILI. I found a trading method suitable for me.

I will keep on trading to gain capitals next month. Last year, the total dividend earned was $\$$424.15, and no capital was gained. April alone has an income more than three times the previous year. It is awesome.
