Cashflow is the key for financial independence. It can be generated by dividends from stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

My definition of Financial Independence is that **monthly passively generated cash is over my monthly expense**.

I contributed to Roth IRA since 2014, which is the money prepared for retirement. My ultimate goal is that the cashflow at the time of retirement can cover living expenses. I am not actively manage Roth IRA accounts and I feel guilty about. Hence, I started the blogging series for Financial Independence to motivate me to maintain investment accounts.

ETFs do not generate consistent dividends like stocks. The yield fluctuates from time to time. So it is hard for me to create a specific projected annual dividend income.
