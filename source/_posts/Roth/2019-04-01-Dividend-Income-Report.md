Last year, much money was used to set limit buy orders. However, the orders were never executed. Hence, Vanguard automatical put the unused money in the VMMXX and generated monthly dividends. Purchases of stocks of BILI and DBX were made and little money was left in the money market. It led to less dividend in 2019.

Last year I bought an additional 10 shares of VOO. The dividend from both VOO and VFINX increased a lot. Their YoY is over 40%. Hence, the increase of dividend from VOO and VFINX offsets the decrease of dividend from VMMXX.

## Capital Gain: $915.04

To my surprise, I earned more this month than last month. The capital gains are similar in two months. The dividend this month earned is much more than that in February. I feel very happy.

I will keep on trading to gain capitals next month. Last year, the total dividend earned was $\$$424.15, and no capital was gained. March alone has income around two times the last year. It is awesome.
