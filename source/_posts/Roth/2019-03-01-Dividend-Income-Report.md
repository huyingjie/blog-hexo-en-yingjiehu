Last year, much money was used to set limit buy orders. However, the orders were never executed. Hence, Vanguard automatical put the unused money in the VMMXX and generated monthly dividends. Purchases of stocks of BILI and DBX were made and little money was left in the money market. It led to less dividend in 2019

## Goal Review: 7%

## Capital Gain: $890.11

All capital gain is from BILI. Last year, I bought BILI at $\$$17.23. Then it dropped to $\$$12. It climbed back to $\$$18 this month. I sold high and bought low between $\$$17.5 and $\$$19.3. After selling all shares, I continued to sell high and buy low to gain more capitals.
