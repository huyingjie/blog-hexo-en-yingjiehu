This project was done in the middle of [100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge](/100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1/).

[Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/hexo-theme-A-RSnippet) | [Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet](http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/)

## Motivation

I wanted to build/customize a theme for saving my solution to leetcode algorithm challenges. 

First, I chose Hugo because of its speed. There is a big drawback that made me gave it up. Hugo will updates automatically when users write posts; it deploys constantly. To achieve this, Hugo saves the contents in the memory. It is the best choice for people who write posts only. It becomes a big pain for developers since Hugo will delay to update if files of themes are changed. I cannot tell immediately whether my code is working or not and have to wait for Hugo for an unknown length of time.

Then I tried Hexo. My blog was made from Hexo and I like it very much. After hours of searching, I finally chose [hexo-theme-Anisina](https://github.com/haojen/hexo-theme-Anisina). I read the code and thought it was messy. I deleted some code and added more features.

I spent 12 hours üòµ (eating time included) to read 184 themes one by one. There are some features I put in my future's todo list.


On January 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 (six days), I released the version 0.1.0 and submitted it [Hexo website](https://hexo.io/themes/).

Though minimalism is good and simplicity seems nice, I want to have more features. The goal of the theme is to include as many features as possible. 


## A-RSnippet Theme community

I hope this open source project is sustainable and can last for a long time. This is the reason I created Discord, Patreon, an email newsletter, and a forum. Together with GitHub issues, they serve all purposes.

1. [Forum](https://arsnippet.freeflarum.com/)

	The community can help each other. New users can search all tutorials and former problems here.
	
2. [Discord](https://discord.gg/CB6CPzq)

	I am accessible in person on Discord. I set a limitation.
	
	In the public channels on Discord, people are forced to speak English only because I want to build an international community, not just for Chinese. (95% of themes on official Hexo website were made by Chinese). Hexo is so powerful that I hope it can attract more people.
	
	After the problems are solved, people are required to create new posts on the forum to describe the solution.
	
	A private channel is for users from Patreon.
	
	A private channel is for sponsors if I can have one.
	
3. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/arsnippet)
	
	I appreciate people who support the development by giving me money. They are the people to whom I should pay attention and give more service.
	
	When people become a backer, they will be automatically added to Discord and assigned special badges. They can access a private channel. In the channel, they can ask me questions in Chinese and write posts for them if questions are answered.
	
	After each release, I will create a poll of potential new features for the next release. It is how I take care of people on Patreon within my limited time. 

4. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/huyingjie/hexo-theme-A-RSnippet/issues)

	New issues and features I decide to develop for the next release.

5. Email newsletter

	GitHub will notify users if a new version is released. This bothers me a lot when I use some open-source projects. I have to check their repos regularly or do not update anymore. 
	
	Users can subscribe to the email newsletter to get updated for each new release.
		
6. If I have over 10 backers on Patreon, I will try streaming to answer users' questions on Twitch.

### the first star

The first star is from [nogajun](https://github.com/nogajun), a Japanese guy. Thank you!! „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å©„ÅÜ

### Setup a new forum

I searched online and found [flarum](http://flarum.org/). It is a forum app that uses PHP. I like discord and NodeBB. Because both of them require cloud server, I have to pay an additional fee if I use them. 

Luckily, I found a website [freeflarum.com](http://freeflarum.com) that hosts Plarum forum for free. Their business model is to show some ads on the free forums. So far, I do not see any ads and am not sure when and what ads will show.

Making open source project is really time-consuming. If there is no sustainable business model, most of good open-source repos will not update regularly.

### Create guidelines on the forum

I copied some guidelines from official flarum forum and added instructions for each type of posts. I took me hours to finish. Maintaining open-source project is time-consuming.

	### Thank you for choosing A-RSnippet theme. 
	
	This forum was built on freeflarum.com for free. freeflarum.com will show some ads to maintain the free service. I cannot control the content of ads or whether ads will show or not.

## 2018-01-30 Tuesday

1. The bug was solved. It was deleted from the [tutorial](http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/tutorial/) and  README.md on GitHub.
	
	```
	Existing Bugs
	
	-* list-category-leetcode layout
	
		I used `site.categories.findOne({name: page["search_word"]}).posts.sort('title', 1).each(function(post) {}` to get the posts for a specified categories. There are two bugs that I don't know how to solve.
	
		* You must use `["language", "python"]` format for the `categories` in the front matter. Otherwise, the post does not appear in the list.
		* Hyphen (`-`) cannot be included in the category names.
	
	```
2. Use `sort_by_update` in `_config` file to decide how to sort posts on homepage, by publish date or by update date.
