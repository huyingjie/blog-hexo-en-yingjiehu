Main Commitment: I will go to the gym to take classes every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 2018-02-28

<!-- more -->

## Rules

1. I will go to the gym to take classes every day. My focus is on yoga. But not every day has a class suitable for my schedule.
2. I will [tweet my progress every day](https://twitter.com/yingjieYJH), with the hashtag `#100daysofFitness #100DaysOfX #fitness` and note which day of the challenge Iâ€™m on.
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
4. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100daysofFitness` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#100daysofFitness` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Motivations

There is a gym next to my apartment. I did not use in the past because New York Sports Club in which I had membership has branches in different locations. In addition, the price of neighbourhood gym is more expensive.

Today I decided to buy one second-hand gym membership because I was encouraged by two friends in the yesterday's get-together. The expiration date is July 11 and the length of time from today is over 4 month. I hope I can finish the challenge before expiration date. 

## Milestone

* 1 Day: [2018-02-28 Wednesday](#Day-1-2018-02-28-Wednesday)
* 7 Days: [2018-03-10 Saturday](#Day-7-2018-03-10-Saturday)
* 30 Days
* 60 Days
* 90 Days
* 100 Days

## LOG

### Day 1: 2018-02-28 Wednesday

**Class**: Power Yoga 

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* The first fitness class I took this year

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I was late for class. Most of the time I cannot see the teacher because other students blocked my eyesight.

The Yoga is a little bit different from other Yoga classes taken in the past. My mind cannot figure out the reason.

<hr>

### Day 2: 2018-03-02 Friday

**Class**: Pilates sculpt

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* One-hour pilates sculpt

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I don't like the big ball. I have no choice. This is the only class offered on Friday afternoon.

<hr>

### Day 3: 2018-03-03 Saturday

**Class**: Yoga

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* One-hour yoga

**Thoughts and Emotions**

It is the same teacher that teaches power yoga on Wednesday. The postures are the same.

<hr>

### Day 4: 2018-03-06 Tuesday

**Class**: Zumba

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* One-hour zumba

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I like the teacher. I tried once Zumba course in New York Sports Club. It is just like dancing. This time, the songs chosen were so vivid, and I smiled most of the time. I liked the postures. The course has the most students among 4 courses I joined in. This is the course I want to attend every week.

<hr>

### Day 5: 2018-03-08 Thursday

**Class**: Zumba

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 45-min zumba

**Thoughts and Emotions**

Different teacher with the class on Tuesday. 

Tuesday's class has beautiful music and Thursday's class burns more calories.

Today's class has more students than Tuesday's.

I like both of them.


<hr>

### Day 6: 2018-03-09 Friday

**Class**: Yoga

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 30-min yoga

**Thoughts and Emotions**

The pace of today's Yoga class is very slow. I like the slow pace, but I do not feel comfortable.

The causes may be

1. I did not take breakfast.
2. Yesterday's Zumba class was so intense that muscles are sore.
3. I did not take medication.

I quitted the class half-way. The reluctant decision is that I will not exercise on Friday because I do enjoy none of the classes.

<hr>

### Day 7: 2018-03-10 Saturday

**Class**: Bolly X

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 50-min Bolly X

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I don't like Indian music and will attend Bolly X class any more.

<hr>

### Day 8: 2018-03-11 Sunday

**Class**: Core & more

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 15-min core & more

**Thoughts and Emotions**

The teacher arrived 15 minutes late. I do not like the style of the course. It is also too intensive for me now.

**Tomorrow's plan**

Zumba. I need Zumba to give me a positive experience of taking fitness classes.

### Day 9: 2018-03-12 Monday

**Class**: Zumba

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

<hr>

### Day 10: 2018-03-13 Tuesday

**Class**: Zumba

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 60 minutes Zumba

**Thoughts and Emotions**

3-lb dumbell per hand for half class.

Yesterday's class took a lot of energy. My upper arm cannot hold dumbells all the time.

<hr>

### Day 11: 2018-03-14 Wednesday

**Class**: advanced body condition

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

1-hour advanced body condition

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I liked the teacher. This is the only teacher in the neighborhood gym that does all postures in class.

When we trained our legs, she put more weight. She has the best body shape among all female teachers. 

Even if I cannot follow all postures, I will continue to attend her class.

I have exercised for consecutive 7 days. Good work.

**Tomorrow's plan**

I will have a Japanese class at night. No exercise tomorrow.

<hr>


### Day 12: 2018-03-17 Saturday

**Class**: Ninja Balance

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

Cardiac training + strength training

Very hard for me.

I am worried that I do not have the strength to do Zumba toning tomorrow. I might skip tomorrow's exercise.

The class today has fewer students than normal. I was on the 3rd row and was blocked by students in the front rows not to see the mirror. It took more effort to see the teacher and the mirror from the crowd.

Writing a detailed plan of a day is helpful.
