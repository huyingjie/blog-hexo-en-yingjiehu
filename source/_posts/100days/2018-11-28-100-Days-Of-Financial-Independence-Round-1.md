Main Commitment: I will learn or practice trading stocks and options to get dividend.

Start Date: 2018-10-28

<!-- more -->

## Background

I finished reading the book Rich Dad and Poor Dady on 2018-10-28, and suddenly wondered how much money was needed to get enough stock dividend to cover living cost.

After extensive research online, some blogs tracking the progress of accumulating dividend convinced me that the idea was doable.

Ultimate long-term financial goal: Finance Independence

This challenge will help me develop the routine to follow stock market closely and train myself to trade insanely reasonably.

[http://dsfi.yingjiehu.com](http://dsfi.yingjiehu.com) tracks dividend progress.

## Rules

1. I will study/practice/write trading/draw lines for stocks every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day (Day 1: 2018-10-28 Sunday)](#Day-1-2018-10-28-Sunday)
2. [7 Days (Day 7: 2018-11-03 Saturday)](#Day-7-2018-11-03-Saturday)
3. [30 Days (Day 30: 2018-11-27 Tuesday)](#Day-30-2018-11-27-Tuesday)
4. [60 Days (Day 60: 2018-12-31 Monday)](#Day-60-2018-12-31-Monday)
5. [90 Days (Day 90: 2019-03-08 Friday)](#Day-90-2019-03-08-Friday)
6. [100 Days (Day 100: 2019-03-24 Sunday)](#Day-100-2019-03-24-Sunday)

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Review

This is the second 100-day-challenge I have finished. It is from 2018-10-28 to 2019-03-24.

Unlike other challenges, I love stocking market. It is easier for me to keep on working every day towards my ultimate goal -- Financial Independence.

During the process, I realized

* Options are suitable for my trading style. I can make more without trading.
* In my current situation, the dividend should not be the primary cash flow even though my ultimate goal is to earn enough dividend to cover living expense.
* Earning capital by trading within a range is the most suitable way for me.

I earned more than $\$$1000 from BILI via the trading style used and am very satisfied with this result. It is twice the dividend earned for the 2018 entire year.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I finally had an idea how to diversify a portfolio. There are 11 sections in the U.S. stock markets. Each section will have 10 stocks. Each stock will produce $\$$400 annual forward dividend.

The total annual forward dividend will be

$\$400 \times 11 \times 10 = \$44000$

**Tomorrow's plan**

* Continue to select stocks

In summary, the biggest achievements were to select stocks in 11 sections and to calculate how many shares needed to generate $\$400$ annual forward dividend.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Time-consuming and tired. I am happy that I figured out how to achieve diversification. However, I am still confused when to buy stocks to acquire sufficient shares.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

It has been a week that Interactive Broker did not finish reviewing my application.

Because of Meng Wanzhou's arrest in Canada, the stock market dropped a lot. Luckily, I did not buy much.

I am worried about whether the sold put option of T (AT&T) and BBBY (Bed Bath&Beyond) would be executed.

**Tomorrow's plan**

The limit order to sell stocks have setup. I can do nothing but wait.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

In the morning, ET was sold automatically because of a limit order. In the afternoon, I decided to buy back because the whole stock market fell again.

It made the basis cost of 100 shares of ET reduced from 14.25 to 13.98. Awesome!

**Tomorrow's plan**

Think about a plan to reduce the basis cost of stocks.
