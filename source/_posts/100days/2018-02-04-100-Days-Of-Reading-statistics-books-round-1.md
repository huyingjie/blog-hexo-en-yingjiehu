Main Commitment: I will read books about Statistics at least 30 minutes per day for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 2018-02-04

A companion project to [100 Days of Reading Paper](100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1).

<!-- more -->

## Rules

1. I will read books about Statistics at least 30 minutes every day.
2. I will [tweet my progress every day](https://twitter.com/yingjieYJH), with the hashtag `#100DaysOfReading #100DaysOfX #statistics #DataScience` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
4. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100DaysOfReading` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#100DaysOfReading` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

	3 Options
	
	* Like tweets
	* Leave a comment
	* (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day)


## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Motivations

I forgot a lot of knowledge. 

This time, I wwill read books again but not force myself to remember everything. The goal is to write down notes and save on the website <http://notebook.yingjiehu.com>

Searching notebook is my friend, not searching Google.

## LOG
### Day 1: 2018-02-04 Sunday

**Book**: [Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed](http://amzn.to/2BbcwXB)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Page 1-8

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I like the book. It is easy to read. The disadvantage is that it is toooooooo thick. 

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Read Chapter 1

<hr>

### Day 2: 2018-02-06 Tuesday

**Book**: [Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed](http://amzn.to/2BbcwXB)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* page 8-9

**Thoughts and Emotions**

* Some terminology names are different from other statistics books.

	* $Y_i$: the value of the response variable in the $i$th trial
	
		It used the word "trial". I rarely meet the word in other statistics books.
	
* Some Math symbols conventions are different.
	1. mean of $\varepsilon_i$

		* this book: $E\{\varepsilon_i\}$
		* other books: $E[\varepsilon_i]$
	1. variance of $\varepsilon_i$

		* this book: $\sigma^2\{\varepsilon_i\}$
		* other books: $\sigma^2_{\varepsilon_i}$
	1. covariance of $\varepsilon_i$ and $\varepsilon_j$
	
		* this book: $\sigma\{\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j\}$
		* other books: cov($\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j$)

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x] Read Chapter 1

### Day 3: 2018-02-07 Wednesday

**Book**: [Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed](http://amzn.to/2BbcwXB)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* page 10-11

**Thoughts and Emotions**

Most of the time spent on taking notes on page 10: Important Features of Model.

In short, "Important Features of Model" can be summarized with one line formula: $Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\beta_0+\beta_1X_i, \sigma^2)$

I understand that why the book used verbose language to describe this: the book is for the beginners. Again, different statistics books use different terms. It becomes readers' responsibility to connect all of them. It is hard though.
