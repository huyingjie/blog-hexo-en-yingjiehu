### Day 3: 2019-03-24 Sunday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* Meditation in bed

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Recently, I read several books about neuroscience. I am motivated by the goal of improving the brain.

Most of the activity of a person in one day is controlled by unconsciousness, i.e., habit. I want to develop meditation to be a habit. I waked up for one hour this morning and resumed sleeping. During the wake-up time, the brain produced alpha brainwave, which contains both conscious and unconscious stages. It is easier to develop habits to be that stage. I made use of this stage to make meditation a habit this morning

	* 故天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。
	* 积土成山，风雨兴焉；积水成渊，蛟龙生焉；积善成德，而神明自得，圣心备焉。故不积跬步，无以至千里；不积小流，无以成江海。骐骥一跃，不能十步；驽马十驾，功在不舍。锲而舍之，朽木不折；锲而不舍，金石可镂。蚓无爪牙之利，筋骨之强，上食埃土，下饮黄泉，用心一也。蟹六跪而二螯，非蛇鳝之穴无可寄托者，用心躁也。

	* 山不在高，有仙则名。水不在深，有龙则灵。斯是陋室，惟吾德馨。苔痕上阶绿，草色入帘青。谈笑有鸿儒，往来无白丁。可以调素琴，阅金经。无丝竹之乱耳，无案牍之劳形。南阳诸葛庐，西蜀子云亭。孔子云：何陋之有？
