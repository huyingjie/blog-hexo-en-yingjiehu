### Day 3: 2019-03-24 Sunday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* Meditation in bed

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Recently, I read several books about neuroscience. I am motivated by the goal of improving the brain.

Most of the activity of a person in one day is controlled by unconsciousness, i.e., habit. I want to develop meditation to be a habit. I waked up for one hour this morning and resumed sleeping. During the wake-up time, the brain produced alpha brainwave, which contains both conscious and unconscious stages. It is easier to develop habits to be that stage. I made use of this stage to make meditation a habit this morning

I realized how I developed meditation in middle school.

I have to recite knowledge in middle school. While lying in bed, I recalled the things in the mind. When distracted, I gently move the attention back.

The same thing happened to think about difficult mathematics problems lying in bed before sleep in college.
