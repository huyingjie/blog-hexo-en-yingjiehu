## Background

> It's not over: The US-China trade war is still on despite 90-day tariff ceasefire, experts say

[Cite from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/us-china-trade-war-still-on-despite-trump-xi-90-days-truce-experts.html)

It started from December 1, 2018. The day after 90 days is Thursday
February 28, 2019. 

During the 90-day negotiation period, China communist party will be doing whatever they can to achieve the requirement from the U.S.

There are lots of things that can be done in 90 days. I should work hard, too.

## Rules

1. I will do whatever I can every day for completion of dissertation.
2. I will follow 90-day tariff ceasefire every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 85 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day (Day 1: 2018-12-05 Wednesday)](#Day-1-2018-12-05-Wednesday)
2. 7 Days 
3. 30 Days 
4. 60 Days 
5. 90 Days 
6. 100 Days 

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.
