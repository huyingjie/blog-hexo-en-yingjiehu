Main Commitment: I will code to make R package for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 2018-01-12

A companion project to [100 Days of Reading Paper](100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1).

<!-- more -->

## Rules

1.  I will code to make R package for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days.
7. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
8. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials.
9. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Milestones

1. 1 Day ([2018-01-12 Friday](#Day-1-2018-01-12-Friday))
2. 7 Days
3. 30 Days
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## LOG
### Day 1: 2018-01-12 Friday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* I created R documentation website using a R package [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown)

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I feel nervous.

`pkgdown` can quickly build a documentation site but it is hard to change styles.

These happen to all packages made by RStudio.

People in my field care less about presentations. I felt frustrated in the past. Statisticians complain machine learning people taking more credits for data analysis work. Appearance is important. If machine learning field produces better websites than statistics, I will go for machine learning.

I feel lucky that FreeCodeCamp helped me learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is doable to customize part of the style. Thanks to having learned JavaScript. I can customize the footer with jQuery. `pkgdown` package does not supply a way to customize footer with templates because the author said he might reconstruct the whole package later!!!! It upsets me.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ]Write documentation for the toy package

### Day 2: 2018-01-14 Sunday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* Decide the name of the new package
* Read others' packages

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I worked one hour for the project today since I thought my rule was one hour instead of 30 minutes.

It is hard to understand other people's code because there are so many functions I do not know. It is like reading an English article (My native language is Chinese) full of words I don't know.

It is discouraging.
