Main Commitment: I will do anything related to Literary Chinese every day

Start Date: 2019-04-14

<!-- more -->

## Background

I always want to read classical Chinese literature during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period. There are many great people born in that period, and I love their literature. However, the biggest obstacle for me is that I do not understand them. Even if I learned some grammars for Literary Chinese in middle school and high school, I could not read new literature on my own. Hence, I missed the opportunity to understand the ideas of the most influential people in Chinese history. Their ideas affected people afterward for over two thousand years.

Here, Literary Chinese is different from Classical Chinese.

* Literary Chinese: the form of written Chinese used since around Spring and Autumn period (early 5th century BC).
* Classical Chinese: the written language of the classical period of Chinese literature, from the end of the Spring and Autumn period (early 5th century BC) to the end of the Han dynasty (AD 220),

The meaning of words are collect on <http://chinese-words.yingjiehu.com/>.

## Rules

1. I will do anything related to Literary Chinese every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day: 2019-04-14 Sunday](#Day-1-2019-04-14-Sunday)
2. [7 Days: 2019-04-22 Monday](#Day-7-2019-04-22-Monday)
3. 30 Days
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.
