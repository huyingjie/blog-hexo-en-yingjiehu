Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary.

Start Date: 2018-09-05 

<!-- more -->

## Background

I finished [the first round of 100 days of Japanese chanllenge](/100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1/) on 2018-09-03. 

I get used to using Anki to reivew old words and memorize new words. Recently, I input all Japanese words in [Genki books](http://links.yingjiehu.com/GenkiI2ndedtextbook) into Anki. I hope I can finish all of them.


## Rules

1. I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from [Genki books](http://links.yingjiehu.com/GenkiI2ndedtextbook) and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfJapanese` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#Anki #Japanese` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#Anki #Japanese` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

	3 Options

	* Like tweets
	* Leave a comment
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day (Day 1: 2018-09-05 Wednesday)](#Day-1-2018-09-05-Wednesday)
2. 7 Days 
3. 30 Days 
4. 60 Days 
5. 90 Days 
6. 100 Days 

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Commute time was used to review cards. I tried iPhone 4s because I want to have a device exclusive for reviewing Anki. The disadvantage of the iPhone 4s is that the screen is too small. It is impossible to show all conjugations of one tense in one screen. I will try the iPhone 4s more days.
