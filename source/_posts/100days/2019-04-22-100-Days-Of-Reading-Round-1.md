Main Commitment: I will practice skills of reading skills every day

Start Date: 2019-04-22

<!-- more -->

## Background

I read several books for reading skills in the past. However, there are no systematic ways for me to practice the techniques mentioned in the book.

Recently, inspiration came that 100-Days-of-Challenge can be an excellent way to track the process of training in reading skills.

The ultimate goal is that reading skills can be one of my habits and all skills of reading become a chunk.

Skills to be practiced

1. Read 4 words at a time
2. Read 5 words at a time
3. Read 1 line at a time
4. Summarize each paragraph

## Rules

1. I will do anything related to Reading Skills every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day: 2019-04-22 Monday](#Day-1-2019-04-22-Monday)
2. [7 Days: 2019-04-28 Sunday](#Day-7-2019-04-28-Sunday)
3. 30 Days
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

	* 8-10 words in most of lines

The number of words per line affects my reading speed.

### Day 2: 2019-04-23 Tuesday

**Time spent**:

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:
* 3 times per line
	* Mutual Fudns for Dummies
* 2 times per line
	* the Talent Code
**Thoughts and Emotions:**

When I was reading the Talent Code, the brain felt what I sensed in the past. There was an intensely uncomfortable feeling in the brain. It is the feeling that showed me that I made progress when preparing for the GRE 10 years ago. I hope the feeling will come back tomorrow and it will become a habit.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

It is a big milestone. In the past, I feared to summarize. Initially, I tried to summarize one chapter. It seemed to be large. Then I tried to summarize each subsection. It was hard, too. Finally, one paragraph was a suitable size for me. I hope that I can develop the habit of summarizing each paragraph unconsciously.
