## Background

Skills to be practiced

1. Work without music
2. Work intensively
3. Train brain

## Rules

1. I will do anything related to practice Skills every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day: 2019-08-20 Tuesday](#Day-1-2019-08-20-Tuesday)
2. 7 Days
3. 30 Days
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.
