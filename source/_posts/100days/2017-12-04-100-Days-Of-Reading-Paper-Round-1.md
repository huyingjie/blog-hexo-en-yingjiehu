The supporting project is [100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis)](100-Days-Of-Code-Round-1-R-data-analysis)

Main Commitment: I will read paper for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 2017-12-18

## Rules

1. I will read paper for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfReadingPaper` and note which day of the challenge Iâ€™m on.
3. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
4. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge.
7. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## LOG
### Day 1: 2017-12-18 Monday
**Paper: [Adaptive design methods in clinical trials â€“ a review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454853)**

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* Started reading paper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials â€“ a review
* Created powerpoint to represent the paper in tomorrow's seminar

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I delayed this challenge for at least two weeks. ðŸ˜­ It was my initial motivation to start [100 Days Challenge](../categories/100-Days-Challenge/). Because of procrastination, I started other 3 challenges ðŸ˜‚

* [100 Days Of Code: Web Development](../100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1/)
* [100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R](../100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1)
* [100 Days Of Japanese](../100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1/)

And restarted writing in this blog which was abandoned in 2014. Three years have passed. Time flies! During three year, I posted only two posts this February.

Thank you for 100 Days Challenge project. I found the way to use the blog with joy. Writing blog posts were suffering, but it is fun to use it to track progress. I add new contents every day even if no new posts are created except 4 posts about challenges. Besides, it helps me practice English writing (I am Chinese).

Back to paper, it is a pain to read paper. However, I found myself enjoy creating powerpoints. Better, I copied the small section of paper into note part of slides then read it. This decreases stress to read a paper over 10 pages.

### Day 2: 2018-01-06
**Paper: [Relaxed Lasso](http://stat.ethz.ch/~nicolai/relaxo.pdf)** by Nicolai Meinshausen

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* Started to read paper again. ðŸ˜‚

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I did an experiment. If I begin to do things that have the highest resistance, will I achieve more? Will the stress level go down? Will I be happier?

Reading paper is on the top list. Then I did it. I feel a little bit relief. But I postponed it to 5 p.m., and this means I will achieve less than yesterday. Completing less can increase stress level, too. Is there a balance.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ] Read "Relaxed Lasso"
