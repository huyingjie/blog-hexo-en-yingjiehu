Main Commitment: I will write every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date: 2018-03-23

<!-- more -->

## Rules

1. I will write every day. My focus is to write academic paper or related literature or notes.
2. I will [tw˜eet my progress every day](https://twitter.com/yingjieYJH), with the hashtag `#100DaysOfWriting #100DaysOfX #academicwriting #writing` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
4. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100DaysOfWriting` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#100DaysOfWriting` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Motivations

Writing academic paper and dissertation is daunting. The idea of writing every day gives me a lot of pressure, too. Recording the journey in the 100-day challenge may be a solution to reduce the stress.

## LOG

### Day 1: 2018-03-23 Friday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:

* 30-min writing
* Started a draft of a methodology paper
* 199 words

**Thoughts and Emotions**

I should write the methodology paper this time last year. Today meeting with the advisor gave me impulsion to start writing, and then I followed the emotion. I struggled to find English words to describe my ideas, and decided to use my mother-tongue Chinese to express in the first draft. It is a draft, not a final paper, and nobody will care which language you have used in a no-one-will-see draft. This writing strategy was inspired by my Japanese writing. My level of Japanese is so low that it adds blockage to thinking flow if I write in Japanese directly. Hence, the first draft is written in Chinese, and then it is translated into Japanese. Separating thinking and languages help me understand which part I have difficulty.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ] 30-min writing of the 1st draft of a methodology paper

I procrastinated to do things since 2018-08-17. My advisor said it had been 10 days and the work can be done in one afternoon. I know. I will try changing the behavior.
