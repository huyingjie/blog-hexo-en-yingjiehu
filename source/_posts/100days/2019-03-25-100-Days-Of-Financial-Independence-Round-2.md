Main Commitment: I will keep trading stocks to gain capital.

Start Date: 2019-03-25

<!-- more -->

## Background

I finished reading the book Rich Dad and Poor Dady on 2018-10-28, and suddenly wondered how much money was needed to get enough stock dividend to cover living cost.

After extensive research online, some blogs tracking the progress of accumulating dividend convinced me that the idea was doable.

Ultimate long-term financial goal: Finance Independence

This challenge will help me develop the routine to follow stock market closely and train myself to trade insanely reasonably.

[http://dsfi.yingjiehu.com](http://dsfi.yingjiehu.com) tracks dividend progress.

I finished [the first round of the 100-day-challenge on 2019-03-25](/100-Days-Of-Financial-Independence-Round-1/). It helped me a lot.
## Rules

1. I will study/practice/write trading/draw lines for stocks every day.
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Milestones

1. [1 Day: 2019-03-25 Monday](#Day-1-2019-03-25-Monday)
2. [7 Days: 2019-03-31 Sunday](#Day-7-2019-03-31-Sunday)
3. [30 Days: 2019-04-29 Monday](#Day-30-2019-04-29-Monday)
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.
