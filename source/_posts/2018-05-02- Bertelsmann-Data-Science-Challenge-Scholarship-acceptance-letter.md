### 2018-04-23 Monday

The deadline shown on the scholarship page was 2018-04-22. I knew it today, one day late. 

Recently, the deadline for the first phase of [Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship front-end track](/Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship front-end track) is closing. I read the forum to see any updates for it. Several students mentioned in the slack channel that there was a scholarship for data science. I was very happy to open the link and was disappointed that the deadline passed.

### 2018-04-24 Tuesday

Today is the first day of the 2nd phase of [Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship front-end track](/Grow-with-Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Acceptance-letter/#2018-04-17-Tuesday-Phase-II-was-rewarded). There was a new slack forum. One student said today was the deadline to apply for Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship. I replied to him with doubt. He said the deadline was extended and I would see it if I clicked to see the application form. I did immediately and finished application within 30 minutes.

The acceptance letter was in the Gmail inbox. I did not open it until I saw one tweet to remind that today is the result day. It made my day! Since the beginning of 2018, three things made me happy. 😆

1. [Awesome Checklist Checklist](https://github.com/huyingjie/Checklist-Checklist) project got [over 1500 stars](http://yingjiehu.com/awesome-checklist-checklist/). (2018-01-08)

2. I got the acceptance letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10)
	> I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored `Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship` whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢

	>It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️

3. I got the acceptance letter from Data Science Scholarship Program Powered by Bertelsmann. (2018-05-02)

	I knew and applied for the scholarship very late. It is not hurt to give a try.
