I was happy to be selected for the full Udacity GrowWithGoogle Scholarship Front End Developer Nanodegree program! It was phase II, i.e., I am in the top 1.5% of all applicants. Projects in phase II are more suitable for my 100 Days Of Web Development than phase I. I will resume 100 days challenge again.
