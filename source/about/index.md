Hi, 

I am Yingjie Hu (Iris, or YJH), a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics in New York University. This website provides videos of summary of academic papers which are usually difficult to understand.

Ph.D. is suffering. Doing research suffers. It is not happy to realize that we forget the contents of paper which we took several hours to understand in the past. I hope videos of paper summary decrease your time and energy to recall the papers related to statistics, machine learning, data science, and big data.  Thank you for becoming a patreon. Your support motivates me to go through the difficulty of reading papers.

Best,

Yingjie
