      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p><img src="2018-01-27-three-followers.png" alt=""></p><p>I learned streaming several years ago and never thought it was related to me. In China, streaming implies that the hosts or hostess are pretty. They have a conversation with the audience.</p><p>I am not that pretty and am not good at social skills. It cannot be suitable for me. I tried streaming today becuase of <a href="https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome-developer-streams repo</a> on GitHub trend.</p><p>I thought it was useful because it can be a way to affect people and show my opinion.</p><p>In the afternoon, the only 45-minute video was recorded though I had talked for 2 hours. The reason is that I followed one tutorial video on YouTube to set keyboard short 1 as starting and 2 as ending. I wrote notes during streaming and triggered the shortcut 😢 . There was no one to watch.</p><p><img src="2018-01-27-chat-with-one-person.png" alt=""></p><p>In the evening, I streamed for 2 hours for 100 days challenge of web development. Three people talked to me. I had a good and long conversation with MofoSilver. Thank you!</p><p>The drawback is that the process of programming is really slow. I cannot find the bug during streaming. After that, I can immediately figure out.</p><p>In addition, streaming took me additional time to setup. Downloading and uploading videos to Youtube took time, too. I guess if I want to continue to do that, I should stop talking to people. Just focus on what I do.</p><h2 id="2018-01-28-Sunday"><a href="#2018-01-28-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="2018-01-28 Sunday"></a>2018-01-28 Sunday</h2><p>I finished my goal today: add internalization for Hexo A-RSnippet theme.</p><p>I was streaming while I was coding. Yesterday, I talked along the way. Today I kept quiet and coding. No new followers. It is normal.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Amy3lj3D-4U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/2018-01-24-A-RSnippet.png"><br><a id="more"></a></p><p>This project was done in the middle of <a href="/100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1/">100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/huyingjie/hexo-theme-A-RSnippet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Repo</a> | <a href="http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet</a></p><p>Link: <a href="http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/</a></p><h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I wanted to build/customize a theme for saving my solution to leetcode algorithm challenges. </p><p>First, I chose Hugo because of its speed. There is a big drawback that made me gave it up. Hugo will updates automatically when users write posts; it deploys constantly. To achieve this, Hugo saves the contents in the memory. It is the best choice for people who write posts only. It becomes a big pain for developers since Hugo will delay to update if files of themes are changed. I cannot tell immediately whether my code is working or not and have to wait for Hugo for an unknown length of time.</p><p>Then I tried Hexo. My blog was made from Hexo and I like it very much. After hours of searching, I finally chose <a href="https://github.com/haojen/hexo-theme-Anisina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexo-theme-Anisina</a>. I read the code and thought it was messy. I deleted some code and added more features.</p><p>I spent 12 hours 😵 (eating time included) to read 184 themes one by one. There are some features I put in my future’s todo list.</p><p>On January 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 (six days), I released the version 0.1.0 and submitted it <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo website</a>.</p><p>Though minimalism is good and simplicity seems nice, I want to have more features. The goal of the theme is to include as many features as possible. </p><h2 id="A-RSnippet-Theme-community"><a href="#A-RSnippet-Theme-community" class="headerlink" title="A-RSnippet Theme community"></a>A-RSnippet Theme community</h2><p>I hope this open source project is sustainable and can last for a long time. This is the reason I created Discord, Patreon, an email newsletter, and a forum. Together with GitHub issues, they serve all purposes.</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://arsnippet.freeflarum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forum</a></p><p> The community can help each other. New users can search all tutorials and former problems here.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://discord.gg/CB6CPzq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a></p><p> I am accessible in person on Discord. I set a limitation.</p><p> In the public channels on Discord, people are forced to speak English only because I want to build an international community, not just for Chinese. (95% of themes on official Hexo website were made by Chinese). Hexo is so powerful that I hope it can attract more people.</p><p> After the problems are solved, people are required to create new posts on the forum to describe the solution.</p><p> A private channel is for users from Patreon.</p><p> A private channel is for sponsors if I can have one.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/arsnippet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a></p><p> I appreciate people who support the development by giving me money. They are the people to whom I should pay attention and give more service.</p><p> When people become a backer, they will be automatically added to Discord and assigned special badges. They can access a private channel. In the channel, they can ask me questions in Chinese and write posts for them if questions are answered.</p><p> After each release, I will create a poll of potential new features for the next release. It is how I take care of people on Patreon within my limited time. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/huyingjie/hexo-theme-A-RSnippet/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub issues</a></p><p> New issues and features I decide to develop for the next release.</p></li><li><p>Email newsletter</p><p> GitHub will notify users if a new version is released. This bothers me a lot when I use some open-source projects. I have to check their repos regularly or do not update anymore. </p><p> Users can subscribe to the email newsletter to get updated for each new release.</p></li><li><p>If I have over 10 backers on Patreon, I will try streaming to answer users’ questions on Twitch.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Milestone"><a href="#Milestone" class="headerlink" title="Milestone"></a>Milestone</h2><ol><li>Submit A-Rsnippet theme to Hexo website and release v0.1.0.

I made some big tables and input syntax of all programming languages into the tables. There are some other programming languages in it, such as Python and JavaScript.</p><p>I will not memorize any syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Main Commitment: I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship every day. (web development track)</p><p>Start Date: 2018-01-11</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>I received <a href="/Grow-with-Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Acceptance-letter/">the acceptance letter of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship (web development track)</a>, Phase I. The scholarship has two phases. The criteria to be selected for Phase II:</p><ol><li>Complete the course before April 11</li><li>Be Active in the Udacity forum or slack</li></ol><p>I will be committed to completing the course. However, I cannot be active in the forum or any social media channel for a long time because of introversion.</p><p>I got the following information on #AMA of slack.</p><blockquote><p>Q: How are you keeping track of our Slack usage in regards to moving on to the second scholarship? I know you can track our forum posts, but not sure how you can accurately measure Slack usage?</p><p>A: We’ll be focusing on quality of your contributions and looking for leadership in the community. To be clear, leadership doesn’t just mean being the expert and answering questions. It also means taking the plunge as a beginner, putting yourself out here in the community, and really embracing this as an opportunity to learn and get support. We see that as leadership as well! In terms of Slack, we’re in here every single day participating with you for the next 3 months. We’ll be tracking participation and leadership through a variety of metrics.</p></blockquote><p>I hate the idea of “leadership”. I don’t want to be led by anyone. I will be responsible for my own study.</p><p>How to thrive as an introvert in an extroverted work environment? My solution is to at least answer 5 questions in the forum every day and to record the progress here, then close the browser for the rest of the day.</p><ul><li>I tend to overdo things. The restriction helps me not consume more energy and time than needed in the social networking websites.</li><li>We will see people learn faster when reading the forum. It will increase pressure. If we read the forum every day for a long time, the pressure will accumulate little by little until defeating us. Restricting the access to the forum will keep the stress level to be manageable.</li><li><strong>If I finish the course, complete the challenge, and do not receive the Phase II scholarship in the end, I will not blame myself for not working harder.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Updates</strong>: Projects will not be graded. But this is my goal of learning. I am considering whether I should work hard for round 2.</p><h2 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules"></a>Rules</h2><ol><li>I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship.

And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.</li><li>The most important goal is to complete the course. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website (forum, slack, and Twitter).</li></ol><h2 id="Some-important-additional-considerations"><a href="#Some-important-additional-considerations" class="headerlink" title="Some important additional considerations"></a>Some important additional considerations</h2><ul><li>Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.</li></ul><h2 id="Milestones"><a href="#Milestones" class="headerlink" title="Milestones"></a>Milestones</h2><ol><li><a href="#Day-1-2018-01-11-Thursday">1 Day: 2018-01-11 Thursday</a></li><li>7 Days</li><li>30 Days</li><li>60 Days</li><li>90 Days</li><li>100 Days</li></ol><h2 id="Template-for-Log"><a href="#Template-for-Log" class="headerlink" title="Template for Log"></a>Template for Log</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">### Day :</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Link**: [Post]()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">1.</span><br><span class="line">2.</span><br><span class="line">3.</span><br><span class="line">4.</span><br><span class="line">5.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Thoughts and Emotions:**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Tomorrow&apos;s plan**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;hr&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><hr></p><h2 id="LOG"><a href="#LOG" class="headerlink" title="LOG"></a>LOG</h2><h3 id="Day-1-2018-01-11-Thursday"><a href="#Day-1-2018-01-11-Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: 2018-01-11 Thursday"></a>Day 1: 2018-01-11 Thursday</h3><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="">Post</a></p><p><strong>Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations)</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Q: feedback on Project Mockup to Article</p><pre><code>* &lt;https://codepen.io/moshiko88s/pen/zpjWey?editors=1000&gt;* &lt;https://codepen.io/elicedx/pen/Qarrjm&gt;</code></pre><p> A: Both of your projects look great.</p></li><li><p>Q: Hi everyone, this is probably a silly question but when I type&lt; button&gt; Click Me! &lt; /button&gt; (I did it without spaces and it worked for my quiz but not on the browser, I just don’t know how to paste as plain text here.

I did not open it until 11 p.m.. It made my day! This month (or from the beginning of 2018), two things made me happy. 😆</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://github.com/huyingjie/Checklist-Checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Checklist Checklist</a> project got <a href="http://yingjiehu.com/awesome-checklist-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 1500 stars</a>. (2018-01-08)</p></li><li><p>I got the acceptance letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10)</p></li></ol><p>I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored <code>Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship</code> whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢</p><p>It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️</p><h3 id="2018-01-11-Thursday"><a href="#2018-01-11-Thursday" class="headerlink" title="2018-01-11 Thursday"></a>2018-01-11 Thursday</h3><p>The excitement to receive Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship disappears!</p><p>There is a big difference between Udacity and FreeCodeCamp: projects.</p><p>Projects on FreeCodeCamp requires students to finish complete websites. In the future, you can show your websites to other people. Here are the first two FreeCodeCamp projects made by me:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/huyingjie/tribute-zhugeliang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Repo</a> | <a href="http://zhugeliang.yingjiehu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project 1: Tribue</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Repo</a> | <a href="http://projects.yingjiehu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project 2: Personal Portfolio</a></li></ul><p>Each project took several hours to finish. It was hard but doable. (This is the essence of learning.)</p><p>In the process of doing projects, I learned how to read official documents of Bootstrap and jQuery without effort. FreeCodeCamp did not teach this. I think almost all students will learn it naturally when working on FreeCodeCamp projects.</p><p>The first two projects on Udacity</p><ol><li>Project: Mockup to Article</li><li>Project: Animal Trading Cards (20 minutes)</li></ol><p>From the title and time suggested, you can see that the projects are a duplicate of other people’s work. Hence, you definitely cannot show them to your friends, coworkers, or future employers.</p><p>Udacity’s projects are a mix of tutorials and exercise. It will teach students what students will use in the “projects” first, and then ask students to reproduce the example. Do you know that every tutorial on FreeCodeCamp is a mix of tutorials and exercise? But FreeCodeCamp does not treat them as a project. They are just tutorials.</p><p>With the same amount time spent, you will learn more from FreeCodeCamp than from Udacity.</p><p>This is the reason I used the strikethrough: <del><strong>Link</strong>: Github Repo| Project</del>. No more project will be produced during the study on Udacity.</p><p><strong>I feel guilty of counting the Udacity project into the challenge.</strong></p><p>Usually, I study tutorials for an hour and code for an hour every day.</p><p>Solution:</p><ul><li>Count anything on Udacity into the tutorial part.</li><li>Continue to do FreeCodeCamp projects.</li></ul><p><strong>Updates</strong></p><p>I read the AMA record and here are my thoughts.</p><ol><li><p>Udacity puts more emphasis on social networking than the quality of learning.</p><p> There are two criteria to be accepted into Round 2 and an addition one that was mentioned in the AMA record.</p><ol><li>Completion of the course before April 11.</li><li>Activities in the slack and the forum.</li><li><p>(not mentioned pubicly) Diversity</p><p>Udacity uses whether students are active in the forum/slack as a critera for the quality of learning. The company cares about the leadership more than learning itself. I do not agree with the idea.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Emphyasis on social networking increases my stress level of learning.</p><p> I am not the fan of spending so much on social networking or collaborating. If I want to be active on either of channels, I have to use willpower to do so. This does not belong to my learning goal. As an introvert, I am reluctant to waste willpower this way.</p></li><li><p>Projects will not be graded. I am disappointed.</p><p> Thanks to FreeCodeCamp. I finally achieve learning and doing projects at the same time. All projects can be contributed to 100 Days of Code challenge.</p><p> Udacity does not emphyasize on the projects at all. I realize that there will be few projects made by students at the end of the course. It is not a good way to track progress during study.</p><p> It reminded me of my previous course on Udacity, making iOS apps. After learning that course, I cannot make an app from start to end.</p></li><li><p>The order of importance: Finishing the course -&gt; Forum activity -&gt; Slack activity.</p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

The design of sales pages is convenient for customers to purchase products and the appearence of pages are comfortable to eyes.</p><p>Gumroad has two plans, free plan and premium plan.</p><ul><li>Free plan: 8.5% + 30 cents per sale</li><li>Premium plan: 3.5% + 30 cents per sale</li></ul><p>Gumroad did a trick on their website.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://gumroad.com/features/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing page</a>.</p><p><img src="gumroad-pricing.png" alt="gumroad pricing"></p><p>“Starts at $\$10$ a month” means there are other plan(s) to charge more.

After searching online, I found the <a href="https://help.gumroad.com/billing-tiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“billing ties” page</a>. Some users wrote the explanation of the billing tiers in details. They asked Gumroad to define “the number of customers”. Gumroad replied that it was the cumulative number of customers!!!!</p><p><img src="gumroad-billing-ties.png" alt=""></p><p>It is not a good premium plan. For example, you create a game and allow other people to download for free. If there are over 5,000 downloads, your premium monthly fee is at least $\$75$. (It is easy to pass 5,000 downloads for a free game.) Then you create another game and charge fees before downloading. You have to calculate which plan will charge less.</p><p>The calculation is not hard. However, it is nice if there exists a calculator we can use immediately.</p><p>P.S.: The other solution: You can create two Gumroad accounts, one for free stuff and the other for paid products.</p><h2 id="Milestone"><a href="#Milestone" class="headerlink" title="Milestone"></a>Milestone</h2><ol><li>The website was published to internet.
