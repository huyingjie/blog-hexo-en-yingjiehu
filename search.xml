Dividend Income: $67.65 Stock Cost/Share Div/Share Share Cost 2019 Dividend 2018 Dividend YoY Forward Dividend Rate VMMXX $\$$1 $\$$0.0.00199 4,830 $\$$4,830 $\$$9.61 $\$$23.25 -59% 2.4% VFINX $\$$149.37 $\$$1.4561 18.76 $\$$2,801.38 $\$$27.31 $\$$19.18 42% 3.38% VOO $\$$184.4 $\$$1.4551 21.119 $\$$3,894.32 $\$$30.73 $\$$11.92 158% 3.2% Total $\$$67.65 $\$$54.35 24.47% Last year, much money was used to set limit buy orders. However, the orders were never executed. Hence, Vanguard automatical put the unused money in the VMMXX and generated monthly dividends. Purchases of stocks of BILI and DBX were made and little money was left in the money market. It led to less dividend in 2019. Last year I bought an additional 10 shares of VOO. The dividend from both VOO and VFINX increased a lot. Their YoY is over 40%. Hence, the increase of dividend from VOO and VFINX offsets the decrease of dividend from VMMXX. Goal Review: 27% CompletionGoal for 2019: Earn $\$$343 in dividend income 1 2 3 Total Completion ratio $\$$8.55 $\$$15.91 $\$$67.65 $\$$92.11 27% Capital Gain: $915.04To my surprise, I earned more this month than last month. The capital gains are similar in two months. The dividend this month earned is much more than that in February. I feel very happy. I will keep on trading to gain capitals next month. Last year, the total dividend earned was $\$$424.15, and no capital was gained. March alone has income around two times the last year. It is awesome.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Neuroscience (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Neuroscience-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will do anything related to neuroscience every day Start Date: 2019-03-29 BackgroundAfter having met different therapists for two years, I finally found something motivating to learn and practice, neuroscience. When I was in the middle school, I adopted the idea of neuroplasticity. The meaning of neuroplasticity for me was that studying and practicing knowledge required by the school can develop the connections in the neurons. Whenever I met difficult tasks or things I did not like to do, I would visualize the growing of connections of neurons in the brain to keep myself motivated. It was working! I can see the effect after practicing for 4 years. Depression makes me feel doing any deep work or studying hard. But deep work and studying are the keys to do research. I want to learn and practice neuroscience at my own pace. The reading speed of the book will be slow. The goal is not finishing the book. The goal is focusing on progress instead of the final results. The practice of neuroscience every day in daily life is the outcome I wish to achieve. I already read a lot for over 1 month before the challenge. It shows my passion and keen interest in neuroscience. Rules I will study/practice/write neuroscience every day. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Milestones 1 Day: 2019-03-29 Friday 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log1234567891011### Day :**Time spent**:**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2019-03-29 FridayTime spent: 3 hours 12 minutes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Progress Length of Time Learn course: Anatomy: Human Neuroanatomy 0:16:02 Learn course: Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life 0:12:21 Take notes: the Upward Spiral 2:43:44 Thoughts and Emotions: I didn’t finish one chapter to take notes for the book the Upward Spiral. I found it was difficult for me to visualize each part in the brain, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus. I spent time searching for pictures to help me visualization in mind. I will buy some physical brain models in the future. Day 2: 2019-04-01 MondayTime spent: 4 hours 55 minutes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Review frontal cortex limbic system hippocampus hypothalamus amygdala cingulate cortex Finished taking notes of Chapter 2 in the book the Upward Spiral Read the book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly Thoughts and Emotions: I hate writes use metaphor as their primary writing style. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is like that. A lot of memories and metaphors and very few neuroscience stuff. I am only interested in neuroscience. Thus I gave up. Tomorrow’s plan Review notes Day 3: 2019-04-02 TuesdayTime spent: 4 hours 55 minutes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Progress Length of Time Read book: The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: A Memoir of Life in Death 0:49:47 Review 0:49:57 Review today’s new notes 0:08:33 Search for good neuroscience blogs 0:55:36 Take notes: the Upward Spiral 1:46:49 Write 100 Days of Neuroscience 0:25:05 Thoughts and Emotions: The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: A Memoir of Life in Death is not my type.

There are 2 goals Taking notes Relating the contents of the book to the book The Upward Spiral Most of the contents of the Willpower Instinct is the subset of the Upward Spiral. Day 7: 2019-04-06 SaturdayTime spent: 3 hours 32 minutes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Progress Length of Time Read book: the brain changes itself 1:01:35 Take notes: the Willpower Instinct 2:30:28 Thoughts and Emotions: The book the Brain Changes Itself talked about neuroplasticity. It doesn’t focus on growing new neurons in the hippocampus, which is great for me. I care about how to enhance prefrontal cortex. Having new neurons does not train the prefrontal cortex.]]></content>

After very long, I felt boring. Day 3: 2019-03-24 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Meditation in bed Thoughts and Emotions: Recently, I read several books about neuroscience. I am motivated by the goal of improving the brain. Most of the activity of a person in one day is controlled by unconsciousness, i.e., habit. I want to develop meditation to be a habit. I waked up for one hour this morning and resumed sleeping. During the wake-up time, the brain produced alpha brainwave, which contains both conscious and unconscious stages. It is easier to develop habits to be that stage. I made use of this stage to make meditation a habit this morning Day 4: 2019-03-25 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Meditation in bed Thoughts and Emotions: Continue to develope a habit of meditation.

I realized how I developed meditation in middle school. I have to recite knowledge in middle school. While lying in bed, I recalled the things in the mind.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Cashflow is the key for financial independence. It can be generated by dividends from stocks, bonds, and ETFs. My definition of Financial Independence is that monthly passively generated cash is over my monthly expense. I contributed to Roth IRA since 2014, which is the money prepared for retirement. My ultimate goal is that the cashflow at the time of retirement can cover living expenses. I am not actively manage Roth IRA accounts and I feel guilty about. Hence, I started the blogging series for Financial Independence to motivate me to maintain investment accounts. ETFs do not generate consistent dividends like stocks. The yield fluctuates from time to time. So it is hard for me to create a specific projected annual dividend income.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will learn or practice trading stocks and options to get dividend. Start Date: 2018-10-28 BackgroundI finished reading the book Rich Dad and Poor Dady on 2018-10-28, and suddenly wondered how much money was needed to get enough stock dividend to cover living cost. After extensive research online, some blogs tracking the progress of accumulating dividend convinced me that the idea was doable.

And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2018-10-28 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2018-11-03 Saturday) 30 Days (Day 30: 2018-11-27 Tuesday) 60 Days (Day 60: 2018-12-31 Monday) 90 Days (Day 90: 2019-03-08 Friday) 100 Days (Day 100: 2019-03-24 Sunday) Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log1234567891011### Day :**Time spent**:**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; ReviewThis is the second 100-day-challenge I have finished. It is from 2018-10-28 to 2019-03-24. Unlike other challenges, I love stocking market. It is easier for me to keep on working every day towards my ultimate goal – Financial Independence. During the process, I realized Options are suitable for my trading style. I can make more without trading. In my current situation, the dividend should not be the primary cash flow even though my ultimate goal is to earn enough dividend to cover living expense. Earning capital by trading within a range is the most suitable way for me. I earned more than $\$$1000 from BILI via the trading style used and am very satisfied with this result. It is twice the dividend earned for the 2018 entire year. LogDay 1: 2018-10-28 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished reading book Rich Dad and Poor Dad Thoughts and Emotions: The book is inspiring. I want to build passive income. Day 2: 2018-10-29 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read Rich Dad Poor Dad Read review of Dad Poor Dad in zhihu, Amazon, goodreads, and Quora Thoughts and Emotions: This is a milestone.

I collected a lot of information yesterday and need to synthesized the information. Day 4: 2018-10-31 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Synthesized information about stock dividend 6 hours Time spent: 6 hours!!! Thoughts and Emotions: Synthesizing information requires more brain power to read and collect information. Day 5: 2018-11-01 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Searched how to reduce the cost basis of stocks Wrote R code to download dividend1:56:55 Wrote R code to calculate dividend0:20:35 Searched alternative to Robinhood0:18:38 Applied for a new robinhood account Thoughts and Emotions: Using R to analysis stock information is connecting with what I learned about R. It made me feel good. Day 6: 2018-11-02 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Searched automatic trading Saw candlestick of stocks Input robinhood transaction to csv Thoughts and Emotions: Automatic trading is time consuming and is easily broke. My goal is to get dividend. I haven’t read candlestick graphs for a long time for two years. It is not hard to read them. The total working time is 9 hours!! Day 7: 2018-11-03 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 100 dividend blogs Wrote R code to calculate the yearly/monthly cost basis of stocks Selected dividend stocks and input into OmniFocus Built a wordpress blog to track progress http://dsfi.yingjiehu.com Thoughts and Emotions: I worked for long hours again. There is a website listing 100 blogs related to use dividend to achieve financial independence. I read all blogs one by one and saved valuable blgos to reread in the future.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-2%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary. Start Date: 2018-09-05 BackgroundI finished the first round of 100 days of Japanese chanllenge on 2018-09-03. I get used to using Anki to reivew old words and memorize new words. Recently, I input all Japanese words in Genki books into Anki. I hope I can finish all of them. Rules I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from Genki books and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfJapanese and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #Anki #Japanese challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #Anki #Japanese each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2018-09-05 Wednesday) 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

I tried iPhone 4s because I want to have a device exclusive for reviewing Anki. The disadvantage of the iPhone 4s is that the screen is too small. It is impossible to show all conjugations of one tense in one screen. I will try the iPhone 4s more days.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Log2018-04-23 MondayThe deadline shown on the scholarship page was 2018-04-22. I knew it today, one day late. Recently, the deadline for the first phase of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship front-end track is closing. I read the forum to see any updates for it. Several students mentioned in the slack channel that there was a scholarship for data science. I was very happy to open the link and was disappointed that the deadline passed. 2018-04-24 TuesdayToday is the first day of the 2nd phase of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship front-end track. There was a new slack forum. One student said today was the deadline to apply for Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship. I replied to him with doubt. He said the deadline was extended and I would see it if I clicked to see the application form. I did immediately and finished application within 30 minutes. 2018-05-02 WednesdayThe acceptance letter was in the Gmail inbox. I did not open it until I saw one tweet to remind that today is the result day. It made my day! Since the beginning of 2018, three things made me happy. 😆 Awesome Checklist Checklist project got over 1500 stars. (2018-01-08) I got the acceptance letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10) I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢 It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️ I got the acceptance letter from Data Science Scholarship Program Powered by Bertelsmann. (2018-05-02) I knew and applied for the scholarship very late. It is not hurt to give a try.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Writing-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will write every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-03-23 Rules I will write every day. My focus is to write academic paper or related literature or notes. I will tw˜eet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfWriting #100DaysOfX #academicwriting #writing and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfWriting challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfWriting each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. MotivationsWriting academic paper and dissertation is daunting. The idea of writing every day gives me a lot of pressure, too. Recording the journey in the 100-day challenge may be a solution to reduce the stress. Milestone 1 Day: 2018-03-23 Friday 7 Days: 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789101112### Day :**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:* -min writing* words**Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-03-23 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 30-min writing Started a draft of a methodology paper 199 words Thoughts and Emotions I should write the methodology paper this time last year. Today meeting with the advisor gave me impulsion to start writing, and then I followed the emotion. I struggled to find English words to describe my ideas, and decided to use my mother-tongue Chinese to express in the first draft. It is a draft, not a final paper, and nobody will care which language you have used in a no-one-will-see draft. This writing strategy was inspired by my Japanese writing. My level of Japanese is so low that it adds blockage to thinking flow if I write in Japanese directly. Hence, the first draft is written in Chinese, and then it is translated into Japanese. Separating thinking and languages help me understand which part I have difficulty. Tomorrow’s plan 30-min writing of the 1st draft of a methodology paper Day 2: 2018-04-20 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 2-hour writing Thoughts and Emotions I wrote from 10:30 pm and 1:30 am. Before writing, stress initiated headache. After writing, I felt delighted. Tomorrow’s plan continue to write Day 3: 2018-04-23 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 3-hour writing Finished the soft draft paper Thoughts and Emotions My customized planning book gave me a lot of courage. Tomorrow’s plan continue to write another paper Day 4: 2018-04-25 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1-hour writing Thoughts and Emotions I see the hope to finish the project. It is a big move. Tomorrow’s plan correct the paper based on today’s meeting Day 5: 2018-08-13 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 3-hour writing Edited a paper and sent to my advisor Wrote new contents for a paper Thoughts and Emotions I felt more relaxed today than before to write paper. Last Friday our department was moved from 650 Frist Ave. to 140 Madison. I like the new space very very much. I did not have any struggle or delay to start editing and writing. It was a productive day. Tomorrow’s plan Wait for my advisor’s email to schedule a meeting to review the paper Continue to write the methodology paper Day 6: 2018-08-14 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 3-hour writing Continued to add new contents to the methodology paper Started a new applicaiton paper Thoughts and Emotions Not as productive as yesterday. The difficulty level of contents increases. I started a paper for application instead of methodology paper. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to write the application paper Day 7: 2018-08-16 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 2-hour writing Thoughts and Emotions I felt upset and the productivity was low. Tomorrow’s plan Edit the paper Continue to write the application paper Day 8: 2018-08-27 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 4-hour writing Edit the paper Continue to write the application paper Thoughts and Emotions It can be considered a productive day. I reached a limit to continue to write the application paper. I tried playing games to have a rest and then resume to write. Though the work is not deep work (editing tables in the paper), I at least was doing something and finished a little. I procrastinated to do things since 2018-08-17. My advisor said it had been 10 days and the work can be done in one afternoon. I know. I will try changing the behavior. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to write the application paper Day 9: 2018-08-28 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Continue to write the application paper Thoughts and Emotions After yesterday’s meeting, I edited part of paper. Today I finished the rest of it. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to write the application paper Day 10: 2018-08-29 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Continue to write the application paper Edit paper Thoughts and Emotions I felt it was hard to concentrate. If I felt nervous, I would play games or recite Japanese words on Duolingo app on my iPhone. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to write the application paper Meet with advisor Day 11: 2018-08-30 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Continue to write the application paper Edit paper Meet with advisor Send out the edited paper Thoughts and Emotions Finally, my advisor said it was ok to send to doctors. A milestone! I will attend a baby shower on Saturday. I will leave on Friday afternoon and will be back on Saturday. I am not sure whether I can work tomorrow and definitely cannot work on Saturday. It is a good week. I work every day this week. Even if I cannot concentrate all the time, small progress is being made all the time. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to write the application paper Day 12: 2018-09-04 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 3-hour writing Thoughts and Emotions Though I didn’t feel passion for writing the result, the progress was made.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Fitness-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will go to the gym to take classes every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-02-28 Rules I will go to the gym to take classes every day. My focus is on yoga. But not every day has a class suitable for my schedule. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100daysofFitness #100DaysOfX #fitness and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100daysofFitness challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100daysofFitness each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. MotivationsThere is a gym next to my apartment. I did not use in the past because New York Sports Club in which I had membership has branches in different locations. In addition, the price of neighbourhood gym is more expensive. Today I decided to buy one second-hand gym membership because I was encouraged by two friends in the yesterday’s get-together. The expiration date is July 11 and the length of time from today is over 4 month. I hope I can finish the challenge before expiration date. Milestone 1 Day: 2018-02-28 Wednesday 7 Days: 2018-03-10 Saturday 30 Days: 2018-05-30 Wednesday 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234567891011### Day :**Class**: **Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-02-28 WednesdayClass: Power Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): The first fitness class I took this year Thoughts and Emotions I was late for class. Most of the time I cannot see the teacher because other students blocked my eyesight. The Yoga is a little bit different from other Yoga classes taken in the past. My mind cannot figure out the reason. Day 2: 2018-03-02 FridayClass: Pilates sculpt Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One-hour pilates sculpt Thoughts and Emotions I don’t like the big ball. I have no choice. This is the only class offered on Friday afternoon. Day 3: 2018-03-03 SaturdayClass: Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One-hour yoga Thoughts and Emotions It is the same teacher that teaches power yoga on Wednesday. The postures are the same. Day 4: 2018-03-06 TuesdayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One-hour zumba Thoughts and Emotions I like the teacher. I tried once Zumba course in New York Sports Club. It is just like dancing. This time, the songs chosen were so vivid, and I smiled most of the time. I liked the postures. The course has the most students among 4 courses I joined in. This is the course I want to attend every week. Day 5: 2018-03-08 ThursdayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min zumba Thoughts and Emotions Different teacher with the class on Tuesday. Tuesday’s class has beautiful music and Thursday’s class burns more calories. Today’s class has more students than Tuesday’s. I like both of them. Day 6: 2018-03-09 FridayClass: Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 30-min yoga Thoughts and Emotions The pace of today’s Yoga class is very slow. I like the slow pace, but I do not feel comfortable. The causes may be I did not take breakfast. Yesterday’s Zumba class was so intense that muscles are sore. I did not take medication. I quitted the class half-way. The reluctant decision is that I will not exercise on Friday because I do enjoy none of the classes. Day 7: 2018-03-10 SaturdayClass: Bolly X Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 50-min Bolly X Thoughts and Emotions I don’t like Indian music and will attend Bolly X class any more. Day 8: 2018-03-11 SundayClass: Core &amp; more Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 15-min core &amp; more Thoughts and Emotions The teacher arrived 15 minutes late. I do not like the style of the course. It is also too intensive for me now. Tomorrow’s plan Zumba. I need Zumba to give me a positive experience of taking fitness classes. Day 9: 2018-03-12 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 60 minutes Zumba Thoughts and Emotions I stood at the end of class and the class was very crowded. Day 10: 2018-03-13 TuesdayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 60 minutes Zumba Thoughts and Emotions 3-lb dumbell per hand for half class. Yesterday’s class took a lot of energy. My upper arm cannot hold dumbells all the time. Day 11: 2018-03-14 WednesdayClass: advanced body condition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1-hour advanced body condition Thoughts and Emotions I liked the teacher. This is the only teacher in the neighborhood gym that does all postures in class. When we trained our legs, she put more weight. She has the best body shape among all female teachers. Even if I cannot follow all postures, I will continue to attend her class. I have exercised for consecutive 7 days. Good work. Tomorrow’s plan I will have a Japanese class at night. No exercise tomorrow. Day 12: 2018-03-17 SaturdayClass: Ninja Balance Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour Ninja Balance Thoughts and Emotions Cardiac training + strength training Very hard for me. I am worried that I do not have the strength to do Zumba toning tomorrow. I might skip tomorrow’s exercise. Day 13: 2018-03-19 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour Zumba Thoughts and Emotions The class is too popular. Day 14: 2018-03-20 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min Zumba Thoughts and Emotions Laundry requires more time than expected. Even if ten minutes late, I can workout for 45 minutes 😀 Day 15: 2018-03-22 ThursdayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min Zumba Thoughts and Emotions I was in the 3rd row. I emerged in exercise. Day 16: 2018-03-24 SaturdayClass: Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min yoga Day 17: 2018-03-25 SundayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Thoughts and Emotions I liked the teacher but she was temporarily here. We danced for several songs and lifted the dumbell for 1 song. It is like HIIT. Day 18: 2018-03-26 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba Day 19: 2018-04-02 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba Day 20: 2018-04-03 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Day 21: 2018-04-08 SundayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Thoughts and Emotions I don’t like the music. I asked two persons and they said if I didn’t like it, then it is not necessary to force myself to attend the class any more. Day 22: 2018-04-12 ThursdayClass: BollyX Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45 min BollyX Thoughts and Emotions Very intensive workout. I like it. Sad. The teacher only teached once. Day 23: 2018-04-17 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Day 24: 2018-04-23 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba Day 25: 2018-04-24 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Thoughts and Emotions The class today has fewer students than normal. I was on the 3rd row and was blocked by students in the front rows not to see the mirror. It took more effort to see the teacher and the mirror from the crowd. Writing a detailed plan of a day is helpful. Day 26: 2018-05-03 FridayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45 min zumba Thoughts and Emotions It is very very extensive. I asked myself to focus on 5 senses to keep up. Day 27: 2018-05-14 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba Thoughts and Emotions Not an intensive workout. It was hard to focus on workout. Day 28: 2018-05-21 MondayClass: BollyX Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour BollyX Thoughts and Emotions The first half course was very intensive because of fast speed. Day 29: 2018-05-22 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Thoughts and Emotions The gym discarded lots of 2 lb dumbbells and provided new 10 lb dumbbells. Luckily, I found a pair of 2 lb dumbbells. Zumba toning has a long period of lifting dumbbells. 3 lb is too heavy for me. Day 30: 2018-05-30 WednesdayClass: Power Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min power yoga Day 31: 2018-06-06 WednesdayClass: Power Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45-min power yoga Day 32: 2018-06-07 ThursdayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 45 min Zumba Day 33: 2018-06-11 MondayClass: Zumba Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 60 minutes Zumba Day 34: 2018-06-14 TuesdayClass: Zumba toning Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1 hour zumba toning Day 35: 2018-06-25 SundayClass: Yoga Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 1-hour yoga Thoughts and Emotions The pace is so slow that I do not like it.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will read books about Statistics at least 30 minutes per day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-02-04 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. Rules I will read books about Statistics at least 30 minutes every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReading #100DaysOfX #statistics #DataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on.

MotivationsI forgot a lot of knowledge. This time, I wwill read books again but not force myself to remember everything. The goal is to write down notes and save on the website http://notebook.yingjiehu.com Searching notebook is my friend, not searching Google. Books Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed Milestone 1 Day: 2018-02-05 Sunday 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234567891011### Day : **Book**: []()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-02-04 SundayBook: Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 1-8 Thoughts and Emotions I like the book. It is easy to read. The disadvantage is that it is toooooooo thick. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 2: 2018-02-06 TuesdayBook: Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): page 8-9 Thoughts and Emotions Some terminology names are different from other statistics books. $Y_i$: the value of the response variable in the $i$th trial It used the word “trial”. I rarely meet the word in other statistics books. Some Math symbols conventions are different. mean of $\varepsilon_i$ this book: $E{\varepsilon_i}$ other books: $E[\varepsilon_i]$ variance of $\varepsilon_i$ this book: $\sigma^2{\varepsilon_i}$ other books: $\sigma^2_{\varepsilon_i}$ covariance of $\varepsilon_i$ and $\varepsilon_j$ this book: $\sigma{\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j}$ other books: cov($\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j$) Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 3: 2018-02-07 WednesdayBook: Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): page 10-11 Thoughts and Emotions Most of the time spent on taking notes on page 10: Important Features of Model. In short, “Important Features of Model” can be summarized with one line formula: $Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\beta_0+\beta_1X_i, \sigma^2)$ I understand that why the book used verbose language to describe this: the book is for the beginners. Again, different statistics books use different terms. It becomes readers’ responsibility to connect all of them. It is hard though.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[New experience I learned streaming several years ago and never thought it was related to me. In China, streaming implies that the hosts or hostess are pretty. They have a conversation with the audience. I am not that pretty and am not good at social skills. It cannot be suitable for me. I tried streaming today becuase of awesome-developer-streams repo on GitHub trend. I thought it was useful because it can be a way to affect people and show my opinion. In the afternoon, the only 45-minute video was recorded though I had talked for 2 hours. The reason is that I followed one tutorial video on YouTube to set keyboard short 1 as starting and 2 as ending. I wrote notes during streaming and triggered the shortcut 😢 . There was no one to watch. In the evening, I streamed for 2 hours for 100 days challenge of web development. Three people talked to me. I had a good and long conversation with MofoSilver. Thank you! The drawback is that the process of programming is really slow. I cannot find the bug during streaming. After that, I can immediately figure out. In addition, streaming took me additional time to setup. Downloading and uploading videos to Youtube took time, too. I guess if I want to continue to do that, I should stop talking to people. Just focus on what I do. 2018-01-28 SundayI finished my goal today: add internalization for Hexo A-RSnippet theme. I was streaming while I was coding. Yesterday, I talked along the way. Today I kept quiet and coding. No new followers. It is normal.]]></content>

Calculate the average of all of collected means use that as estimated mean for the data. Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): combine the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms together to make more accurate predictions than any individual model. reduce the variance for those algorithm that have high variance. An algorithm that has high variance are decision trees, like classification and regression trees (CART). lower variance, increase bias Example of CART: a sample dataset of 1000 instances (x) and we are using the CART algorithm. Bagging of the CART algorithm would work as follows. Create many (e.g. 100) random sub-samples of our dataset with replacement. Train a CART model on each sample.

    <title><![CDATA[A-RSnippet Hexo Theme]]></title>
    <url>%2Fa-rsnippet-hexo-theme%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet Link: http://arsnippet.yingjiehu.com/ MotivationI wanted to build/customize a theme for saving my solution to leetcode algorithm challenges. First, I chose Hugo because of its speed. There is a big drawback that made me gave it up. Hugo will updates automatically when users write posts; it deploys constantly. To achieve this, Hugo saves the contents in the memory. It is the best choice for people who write posts only. It becomes a big pain for developers since Hugo will delay to update if files of themes are changed. I cannot tell immediately whether my code is working or not and have to wait for Hugo for an unknown length of time. Then I tried Hexo. My blog was made from Hexo and I like it very much. After hours of searching, I finally chose hexo-theme-Anisina. I read the code and thought it was messy. I deleted some code and added more features. I spent 12 hours 😵 (eating time included) to read 184 themes one by one. There are some features I put in my future’s todo list. On January 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 (six days), I released the version 0.1.0 and submitted it Hexo website. Though minimalism is good and simplicity seems nice, I want to have more features. The goal of the theme is to include as many features as possible. A-RSnippet Theme communityI hope this open source project is sustainable and can last for a long time. This is the reason I created Discord, Patreon, an email newsletter, and a forum. Together with GitHub issues, they serve all purposes. Forum The community can help each other. New users can search all tutorials and former problems here. Discord I am accessible in person on Discord. I set a limitation. In the public channels on Discord, people are forced to speak English only because I want to build an international community, not just for Chinese. (95% of themes on official Hexo website were made by Chinese). Hexo is so powerful that I hope it can attract more people. After the problems are solved, people are required to create new posts on the forum to describe the solution. A private channel is for users from Patreon. A private channel is for sponsors if I can have one. Patreon I appreciate people who support the development by giving me money. They are the people to whom I should pay attention and give more service. When people become a backer, they will be automatically added to Discord and assigned special badges. They can access a private channel. In the channel, they can ask me questions in Chinese and write posts for them if questions are answered. After each release, I will create a poll of potential new features for the next release. It is how I take care of people on Patreon within my limited time. GitHub issues New issues and features I decide to develop for the next release. Email newsletter GitHub will notify users if a new version is released. This bothers me a lot when I use some open-source projects. I have to check their repos regularly or do not update anymore. Users can subscribe to the email newsletter to get updated for each new release. If I have over 10 backers on Patreon, I will try streaming to answer users’ questions on Twitch. Milestone Submit A-Rsnippet theme to Hexo website and release v0.1.0. (2018-01-24 Wednesday) The first star 2018-01-24 Wednesday v0.1.0 2018-01-23 Make an exampleSite folder included in the theme folder 2018-01-24 Write documentation Found more bugs when writing documentation Adjust the example site Create a Discord Channel Create a Patreon page Connect Patreon to Discord Create a cover photo for the theme Build a brand new website to test the example website Upload to GitHub Use Netlify Add a subdomain name Google site verification Submit the theme to Hexo This is my first time to pull request!!! This is my frist time to release!!! My theme is the frist one on Hexo theme page because of alphabetical order 😂 2018-01-25 Thursdaythe first starThe first star is from nogajun, a Japanese guy. Thank you!! ありがどう Setup a new forumI searched online and found flarum. It is a forum app that uses PHP. I like discord and NodeBB. Because both of them require cloud server, I have to pay an additional fee if I use them. Luckily, I found a website freeflarum.com that hosts Plarum forum for free. Their business model is to show some ads on the free forums. So far, I do not see any ads and am not sure when and what ads will show. Making open source project is really time-consuming. If there is no sustainable business model, most of good open-source repos will not update regularly. Create guidelines on the forumI copied some guidelines from official flarum forum and added instructions for each type of posts. I took me hours to finish. Maintaining open-source project is time-consuming. ### Thank you for choosing A-RSnippet theme. This forum was built on freeflarum.com for free. freeflarum.com will show some ads to maintain the free service. I cannot control the content of ads or whether ads will show or not. You can use MarkDown to write posts. ## 1. All discussion on the forum uses English only.

There is one problem. 123456789I want to hide the text &quot;Related Posts&quot; if no posts are returned.When there is no posts matched, `popular_posts( &#123;&#125; , page )` returns ```&lt;ul class=&quot;popular-posts&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;popular-posts-item&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;popular-posts-title&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/untitled/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;```It makes me impossible to write `if` statement to judge whether there exists at least related post or not.I think `popular_posts( &#123;&#125; , page )` should return empty string or any value equivalent to empty if no posts are related to the current post. I opened the issue on the module’s GitHub. Plan Wait for reply from the issue on the module’s GitHub. 2018-02-09 Friday Add copyright information at the end of the post.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Reading-Python-books-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will read books about Python at least 30 minutes per day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-01-12 Rules I will read books about Python at least 30 minutes every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReading #100DaysOfX #python and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfReading challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfReading each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. MotivationsI had read some programming books in the past. At that time, I input the knowledge into Anki and hoped that I could remember it in the future. My goal of reading books changes. I made some big tables and input syntax of all programming languages into the tables. There are some other programming languages in it, such as Python and JavaScript. I will not memorize any syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check. Besides, it is convenient to compare different languages. It is tough to memorize syntax if multiple programming languages are used in the same period. For example, all languages have boolean, the most basic variable type. There are two values, true or false. Python: True, False R: TRUE, FALSE JavaScript: true, false You can get it. There are 3 ways to present boolean. My brain is reluctant to memorize which language uses which method. Other examples: How to define a function? Whether variables should be declared before usage? Whether variables types should be written when we create variables Whether there is a keyword to declare a variable? and more If you can memorize details of all programming languages you have learned, you are genius in my eyes.

Because Python books follow the structure of most other programming languages, such as Java, C, and C++. The benefit is that I can read more quickly than R books. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 2 Day 2: 2018-01-14 SundayBook: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 2 + exercise Thoughts and Emotions I used 30 minutes to scan Chapter 2.

It slows me down. Lists, tuples, and sets are 3 Python data types which can contain multiple values. The concept will be confusing every time I do not use it for a while. Also, different languages have similar data types like these. Each language has different functions/properties to achieve same basic operations. For example: concatenate two lists Python 1234l1 = [1, 2]l2 = [3]l1 + l2 R 1234l1 = list(1, 2)l2 = list(3)c(l1, l2) JavaScript 1234var l1 = [1, 2]var l2 = [3]l1.concat(l2) After one day, can you remember which language uses which syntax? Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 5 Day 5: 2018-03-15 ThursdayBook: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): page 12 - 15 Thoughts and Emotions Different type of books shows a different list of freqent functions. Applying 80-20 rules to python means functions used in the book Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python are more frequently used? Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 1 Day 6: 2018-03-22 ThursdayBook: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 41 - 47 Thoughts and Emotions I am bored with reading Python syntax and decided to skip Chapter 1 first.

Start Date: 2018-01-12 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. Rules I will code to make R package for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

These happen to all packages made by RStudio. People in my field care less about presentations. I felt frustrated in the past. Statisticians complain machine learning people taking more credits for data analysis work. Appearance is important. If machine learning field produces better websites than statistics, I will go for machine learning. I feel lucky that FreeCodeCamp helped me learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is doable to customize part of the style. Thanks to having learned JavaScript. I can customize the footer with jQuery. pkgdown package does not supply a way to customize footer with templates because the author said he might reconstruct the whole package later!!!! It upsets me. Tomorrow’s plan Write documentation for the toy package Day 2: 2018-01-14 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Decide the name of the new package Read others’ packages Thoughts and Emotions I worked one hour for the project today since I thought my rule was one hour instead of 30 minutes. It is hard to understand other people’s code because there are so many functions I do not know. It is like reading an English article (My native language is Chinese) full of words I don’t know. It is discouraging. Future’s plan]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Helping Students in Udacity Forum [Dumped]]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Helping-Students-in-Udacity-Forum%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship every day. (web development track) Start Date: 2018-01-11 BackgroundI received the acceptance letter of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship (web development track), Phase I. The scholarship has two phases. The criteria to be selected for Phase II: Complete the course before April 11 Be Active in the Udacity forum or slack I will be committed to completing the course. However, I cannot be active in the forum or any social media channel for a long time because of introversion. I got the following information on #AMA of slack. Q: How are you keeping track of our Slack usage in regards to moving on to the second scholarship? I know you can track our forum posts, but not sure how you can accurately measure Slack usage? A: We’ll be focusing on quality of your contributions and looking for leadership in the community. To be clear, leadership doesn’t just mean being the expert and answering questions. It also means taking the plunge as a beginner, putting yourself out here in the community, and really embracing this as an opportunity to learn and get support. We see that as leadership as well! In terms of Slack, we’re in here every single day participating with you for the next 3 months. We’ll be tracking participation and leadership through a variety of metrics. I hate the idea of “leadership”. I don’t want to be led by anyone. I will be responsible for my own study. How to thrive as an introvert in an extroverted work environment? My solution is to at least answer 5 questions in the forum every day and to record the progress here, then close the browser for the rest of the day. I tend to overdo things. The restriction helps me not consume more energy and time than needed in the social networking websites. We will see people learn faster when reading the forum. It will increase pressure. If we read the forum every day for a long time, the pressure will accumulate little by little until defeating us. Restricting the access to the forum will keep the stress level to be manageable. If I finish the course, complete the challenge, and do not receive the Phase II scholarship in the end, I will not blame myself for not working harder. Updates: Projects will not be graded. But this is my goal of learning. I am considering whether I should work hard for round 2. Rules I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (web development track) every day I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. The most important goal is to complete the course. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website (forum, slack, and Twitter). Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

Sorry!) into my browser it does not actually show me a button. I feel like I am missing something in the beginning but I don’t know what it is. Can anyone help? A: How about using different browsers? It is good to install multiple browsers on the computer. Then you will know which one has the error, code or browser specific3.4.5.

The expected time to be spent on the Udacity forum and slack will be enormous to be enrolled in the Round 2 scholarship. I dislike spending time this way. It means I give up pursing Round 2 scholarship. Thanks to my roommate. She helped me make the decision. It is tough to give up.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship Acceptance Letter]]></title>
    <url>%2FGrow-with-Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Acceptance-letter%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Log2018-01-10 WednesdayThe acceptance letter was in the Gmail inbox. I did not open it until 11 p.m.. It made my day! This month (or from the beginning of 2018), two things made me happy. 😆 Awesome Checklist Checklist project got over 1500 stars. (2018-01-08) I got the acceptance letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10) I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢 It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️ 2018-01-11 ThursdayThe excitement to receive Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship disappears! There is a big difference between Udacity and FreeCodeCamp: projects. Projects on FreeCodeCamp requires students to finish complete websites. In the future, you can show your websites to other people. Here are the first two FreeCodeCamp projects made by me: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Each project took several hours to finish. It was hard but doable. (This is the essence of learning.) In the process of doing projects, I learned how to read official documents of Bootstrap and jQuery without effort. FreeCodeCamp did not teach this. I think almost all students will learn it naturally when working on FreeCodeCamp projects. The first two projects on Udacity Project: Mockup to Article Project: Animal Trading Cards (20 minutes) From the title and time suggested, you can see that the projects are a duplicate of other people’s work. Hence, you definitely cannot show them to your friends, coworkers, or future employers. Udacity’s projects are a mix of tutorials and exercise. It will teach students what students will use in the “projects” first, and then ask students to reproduce the example. Do you know that every tutorial on FreeCodeCamp is a mix of tutorials and exercise? But FreeCodeCamp does not treat them as a project. They are just tutorials. With the same amount time spent, you will learn more from FreeCodeCamp than from Udacity. This is the reason I used the strikethrough: Link: Github Repo| Project. No more project will be produced during the study on Udacity. I feel guilty of counting the Udacity project into the challenge. Usually, I study tutorials for an hour and code for an hour every day. Solution: Count anything on Udacity into the tutorial part. Continue to do FreeCodeCamp projects. Updates I read the AMA record and here are my thoughts. Udacity puts more emphasis on social networking than the quality of learning. There are two criteria to be accepted into Round 2 and an addition one that was mentioned in the AMA record. Completion of the course before April 11. Activities in the slack and the forum. (not mentioned pubicly) Diversity Udacity uses whether students are active in the forum/slack as a critera for the quality of learning. The company cares about the leadership more than learning itself. I do not agree with the idea. Emphyasis on social networking increases my stress level of learning. I am not the fan of spending so much on social networking or collaborating. If I want to be active on either of channels, I have to use willpower to do so. This does not belong to my learning goal. As an introvert, I am reluctant to waste willpower this way. Projects will not be graded. I am disappointed. Thanks to FreeCodeCamp. I finally achieve learning and doing projects at the same time. All projects can be contributed to 100 Days of Code challenge. Udacity does not emphyasize on the projects at all. I realize that there will be few projects made by students at the end of the course. It is not a good way to track progress during study. It reminded me of my previous course on Udacity, making iOS apps. After learning that course, I cannot make an app from start to end. The order of importance: Finishing the course -&gt; Forum activity -&gt; Slack activity. 2018-04-17 Tuesday Phase II was rewarded!I was happy to be selected for the full Udacity GrowWithGoogle Scholarship Front End Developer Nanodegree program! It was phase II, i.e., I am in the top 1.5% of all applicants.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Reading R books (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Reading-R-books-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will read books about R at least 30 minutes per day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-01-08 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. Rules I will read books about R at least 30 minutes every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReading #100DaysOfX #rstat #DataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfReading challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfReading each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. MotivationsI had read some R books in the past. At that time, I input the knowledge into Anki and hoped that I could remember it in the future. My goal of reading books changes. I made some big tables of programming languages and input the R syntax into the tables. There are some other programming languages in it, such as Python and JavaScript. I will not memorize any R syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check. Besides, it is convenient to compare different languages. It is tough to memorize syntax if multiple programming languages are used in the same period. For example, all languages have boolean, the most basic variable type. There are two values, true or false. Python: True, False R: TRUE, FALSE JavaScript: true, false You can get it. There are 3 ways to present boolean. My brain is reluctant to memorize which language uses which method. Other examples: How to define a function? Whether variables should be declared before usage? Whether variables types should be written when we create variables Whether there is a keyword to declare a variable? and more If you can memorize details of all programming languages you have learned, you are genius in my eyes. Books An R Companion to Applied Regression 2nd Edition Using R and RStudio for Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics (second edition) R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Milestone 1 Day: 2018-01-08 Monday 7 Days: 2018-02-04 Sunday 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234567891011### Day : **Book**: []()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-01-08 MondayBook: An R Companion to Applied Regression 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read from xvii to page 8 Thoughts and Emotions I had read the first two chapters before. At that time, I input the knowledge into Anki and hoped that I can remember it in the future. My goal of reading this book changes. I will input the syntax into the programming language table. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 2: 2018-01-10 WednesdayBook: my R notes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 30 minutes Review R notes taken in the past Thoughts and Emotions My book is not beside me. I reviewed R notes taken in the past to continue the challenge. I am happy to do that. Some old notes were deleted I input notes to the large programming language sheet. Statistical analysis programming languages have some unique data type that other languages do not have. For example, R has a vector data type. Elements in a vector have the same atomic data type, such as string or integer. Python has a list while JavaScript has an array. Both of them can create a vector of data, but their elements can be a mix of string and integer. A more specific example: JavaScript: var ourArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 23]; Python: things = [“shoes”, 85, 8.8, “ball”] R converts a vector of a mix of string and integer into a vector of string automatically. 123456&gt; ourArray = c(23, "John")&gt; ourArray[1] "23" "John"&gt; things = c("shoes", 85, 8.8, "balls")&gt; things[1] "shoes" "85" "8.8" "balls" Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 3: 2018-01-11 ThursdayBook: Using R and RStudio for Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics (second edition) Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Chapter 1: page 1-6 Thoughts and Emotions The book is like a dictionary but is worse than a dictionary. It is not suitable for beginners. I am not a beginner and can try it. I spent most of taking notes: input the functions into my large programming language sheet. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 1 Day 4: 2018-01-12 FridayBook: Using R and RStudio for Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics (second edition) Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 7-14 Thoughts and Emotions Most of time I did copy and paste from the book to my big sheet. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 2 Day 5: 2018-01-18 WednesdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page ~ 9 Thoughts and Emotions I spent most of the time taking notes; I input syntax into my big programming sheet. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 1 Day 6: 2018-02-03 SaturdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 12, 13 Thoughts and Emotions I spent most of the time taking notes; I input syntax into my big programming sheet. No choice. If notes are not taken now, I will spend more time to search online to find them. It is the choice between spending time now or spending more time in the future. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 1 Day 7: 2018-02-04 SundayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 13-16 Thoughts and Emotions Page 15 recommended several good functions to list packages installed on the computer and loaded in the session, and so on. They are useful if I want to clean packages. One drawback of all R books I read so far is that none of them provide functions how to uninstall and unloaded packages. I guess most of the R users do not uninstall packages after installing them. The same thing happened to load packages. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 1 Day 8: 2018-02-06 TuesdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): page 17 - 22 Finished Chapter 1 Thoughts and Emotions Page 18 There are 7 steps in the example on “Section 1.8 Working through an example”. I remember when I read the Chapter first time, I did not know how to do 123. List the functions and datasets available in the package6. Run the example that comes with the Arthritis dataset This time, I took notes during the reading and knew why this happened. For the question 3, the book said you could find the functions of packages using the function `help(package=”packageName”). The book used the different language between the content and the question For the question 6, the book never said example() could accept a dataset name as the argument. It mentioned that examples of packages could be run by example(). Maybe the author hoped readers looked for answers by themselves by using ?example. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 2 Day 9: 2018-02-14 WednesdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 23 - 29 Thoughts and Emotions vector matrix array data frame factor These were the most friction when I learned R at the beginning. R has the biggest number of data type among programming languages I learned so far. It is tough to change the mindset from C to R. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 2 Day 10: 2018-02-16 FridayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Page 30 - 38 Thoughts and Emotions There are a lot of types datasets. Each one has a different way. I am happy that inputting these into the programming language syntax table. I input a lot of methods before. R in Action provided more. It is frustrating when every book gives a different subset of all possible types of datasets. Importing xlsx files requires Java. I used package XLConnect several years. I re-ran the code again last year, and there were some errors with Java. Searching online did not give me an effective solution. Again, the more stuff one package depends on, the less possibility of code that can be reproduced in the future. Reducing dependencies is the key to reproducibility. The importance of reproducible reports is much lower than dependencies. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 2 Day 11: 2018-03-07 WednesdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 2 Page 39-49 Thoughts and Emotions Slow progress. I hope I do not need to read again. Tomorrow’s plan Chapter 3 Day 12: 2018-03-22 ThursdayBook: R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R 2nd Edition Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 2 Page 50-55 Thoughts and Emotions I did not find a good way to arrange graph options.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator Link: http://gumroadplancalculator.yingjiehu.com/ MotivationGumroad is a website to sell digital products or give out for free. The design of sales pages is convenient for customers to purchase products and the appearence of pages are comfortable to eyes. Gumroad has two plans, free plan and premium plan. Free plan: 8.5% + 30 cents per sale Premium plan: 3.5% + 30 cents per sale Gumroad did a trick on their website. Here is the pricing page. “Starts at $\$10$ a month” means there are other plan(s) to charge more. Then I clicked “Learn more” and it gave me: “Learn more” pages does not give me more information. After searching online, I found the “billing ties” page. Some users wrote the explanation of the billing tiers in details. They asked Gumroad to define “the number of customers”. Gumroad replied that it was the cumulative number of customers!!!! It is not a good premium plan. For example, you create a game and allow other people to download for free. If there are over 5,000 downloads, your premium monthly fee is at least $\$75$. (It is easy to pass 5,000 downloads for a free game.) Then you create another game and charge fees before downloading. You have to calculate which plan will charge less. The calculation is not hard. However, it is nice if there exists a calculator we can use immediately. P.S.: The other solution: You can create two Gumroad accounts, one for free stuff and the other for paid products. Milestone The website was published to internet.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 12: RSnippets.com Link: RSnippets.com The site is auto-deployed. Milestone The website was published to internet. (2018-01-05 Friday) First pull Over 100 stars Support open source projectsBecome a Patron! 2018-01-05 FridayI learned several programming languages by myself and failed, such as PHP. Every time I planned to learn a new programming language, I would look for books to read, video tutorials on Lynda.com, videso on YouTube. After doing this for several times and reading books for several years, I found people provided more books than necessary in a book list for beginners. The book list is so long that it overwhelms and discourages beginners; beginners will quit after reading first several hundred pages without a completed project. Watching tutorials a faster learning method than reading. But without doing any projects or exercise after watching, forgetting is the final outcome. Usually, I have an idea, then search online for the technology involved. One project makes use of multiple programming languages. If I went through the all process of reading books first and doing projects next, I would not complete any project when considering there were a lot of things to do in other aspects of life. One solution I saw some people mentioned online is to have a project at hand before learning a language. Well, the problem is that as a beginner, I will underestimate the complexity of the projects I choose most of time. If I have a question, the answers online involve lots of knowledge I do not know, and thus I cannot understand the solutions at all. I have been in the two loops for several years, reading books which can over 500 pages or not understanding solutions online. In December 2017, I started (again) learning front-end web development with FreeCodeCamp.com. I am amazed at projects in the website. They requires limited knowledge and beginners can build a website that can be shown to other people. One thing I learned in the process is that learning and practicing should be mixed together. The method was used when we were in school. As an adult, sometimes we forget it; sometimes we rush to our goal: finish reading books; sometimes we want to have some practice, but we have no idea what projects should be picked. RSnippets.com is a website that collects projects suitable for beginners. They can proudly put completed projects on a personal portfolio page. They do not need full understanding or leanring the programming language to start a project.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Practicing-Makeup-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will practice makeup. Start Date: 2017-12-31 This is a very personal project. Making up is a required skill for women. I thought it was a waste of time and worried about the harmful integridents in makeups. Despite my negative emotion towards makeup, I have to think about one method to push myself to learn it. This is the inspiration of the challenge. “100 Days of Challenge” can be extended to any skill that you do not enjoy but is required to be learned. Rules I will try to practice makeup once per day. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Watching makeup tutorials will not count towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-31 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2018-01-11 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Reference Tutorials Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) LOGDay 1: 2017-12-31 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Practice based on Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) My skin color is darker than the host and I have dark circles. The eye color she used does not have an effect on my skin. Thoughts and Emotions: I like the tutorial Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) very much. Because it is suitable for acne skin. Most of the hosts have good skin (or they adjust color) and do not emphasize on how to conceal red spots. My roommate said the foundation is much lighter than my skin. I will try different foundation tomorrow. Tomorrow’s plan Try a different foundation Day 2: 2018-01-01 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I made up before going out. Thoughts and Emotions: I applied both the new foundation and old foundation. I looked whiter. Tomorrow, the only new foundation will be used. Tomorrow’s plan Use the new foundation only Day 3: 2018-01-02 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I used the foundation stick only. It does not cover dark spot well. Thoughts and Emotions: I am not sure whether the foundation stick not well or my technique is not good. I got the foundation sticks from Clinique’s Black Friday sales one month ago. There is no foundation stick from other brand as a control group. Tomorrow’s plan Concealer with liquid lighter foundation + Foundation Stick Day 4: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Makeup before going to work. This is the first time I did it. Thoughts and Emotions: Forget about how much time would be spent time on makeup. Just do it. Then I did it. Little liquid foundation cannot cover dark spot. I think it is ok to have dark spot which makes me look not fake. I fogot applying the concealer which is close to my skin color. Tomorrow’s plan Don’t forget to apply the concealer which is close to my skin color. Day 5: 2018-01-08 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup before going to the department Thoughts and Emotions: I missed 4 days in a row. On Wednesday, I did not have time for makeup in the morning. Then the next few days, I chose to stay at home, and the motivation to makeup was near 0. I am happy to resume the challenge. Tomorrow’s plan No plan. If I continue to do it tomorrow, it will be great. Day 6: 2018-01-10 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3:30 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: My lamp color is yellow. I cannot see the true effect from the mirrow if I makeup at night. The sky becomes darker around 3:30 p.m.. It motivated to makeup today. Day 7: 2018-01-11 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: After reading tutorials on Udacity (Grow with Google Challenge scholarship), I used makeup as a rest.

    <title><![CDATA[Project: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics]]></title>
    <url>%2FAwesome-Shiny-Apps-for-Statistics%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Milestone The website was published to internet. (2017-12-25 Monday) Receiving the first feedback that a teacher plans to use the list in his class (2017/12/28 Thursday) Receiving the first feedback that a teacher is using/used the list in his Support open source projectsBecome a Patron! 2017-12-26 Tuesday After one day of publishing, some numbers GitHub 16 stars 3 forks 3 watchers Twitter 31 ReTweeted 77 likes This is the first for me to get over 10 stars on GitHub and the first to get over 10 likes and retweets on Twitter. I am happy that people like the idea of the project. 2017-12-28 ThursdayI got positive feedback from mo_feezy on Reddit: Hi, cool resource. I won’t be teaching stats until next fall, but this will be handy. One milestone is achieved: Receiving the first feedback that a teacher plans to use the list in his class My initial goal is to have a mature list before next Spring semester when teachers can use it as a reference. But the majority of basic statistics are not covered by Shiny Apps in the list. I hope it will mature before next fall.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Japanese Class Weekly Paragraph]]></title>
    <url>%2FJapanese-Class-Weekly-Paragraph%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Our Japanese teacher asked us to talk about what we did last week as an oral exercise. It starts with one student asking another “週末は何をしましたか”。 The answer requires at least three sentences. We use the sentence structures taught and look up new words if necessary. The paragraphs here were what I prepared for each class. It can be a good record to show learning progress. I write Chinese sentences first, then translate them into Japanese. Chinese version below is very rough. It contains ideas more than the Japanese version. You can freely skip Chinese and read Japanese only. Template for Log123##**Japanese:****Chinese:*** 2017/11/19 WednesdayJapanese: 週末は うちで いました。アンキーへに 教科書の名詞[めいし]⓪と形容詞[けいようし]③ と 動詞[どうし]①を 入力[にゅうりょく]①しました。 私が日本の漫画を​​読んでみた。彼氏彼女の事情[じじょう]⓪ と カードキャプターさくら クリアカード 。難しかったです。どれも 終えなかった。有名な 動画[どうが] 魔法少女[しょうじょ]まどかを 見ました。 Chinese: 周末一直呆在家里把课本上名词动词形容词输入anki10000高频词汇里部分单词和书上单词合并 (不知道怎么说)试着读日本漫画，很难。尝试了彼男彼女的故事，魔法少女樱clear card。全部放弃魔法少女樱重新开始连载。看完了连载到现在为止的中文翻译看完了著名动画片魔法少女小圆重新看看了部分的魔法少女樱新看著名动画片 夏目友人账魔卡少女樱，她爸爸和最好的朋友都对樱用formal，樱对他们用informal。不是很理解为什么会这么使用。完全不理解从香港来的男主角为什么日语说得那么好 2017/11/29 WednesdayJapanese: thanksgivingに たくさん 買い物を しました。ドメイン名[めい]を 一つ 買いました。clinique の 商品[しょうひん] は２５％を引[ひ]いました。 cliniqueは 原寸[げんすん]◎の商品[しょうひん]と ろく piece を 送[おく]りました。でも、昨日 packageの中に 原寸[げんすん]◎の商品[しょうひん]が ありません。だから、cliniqueに オンライン chatで 聞きました。 Chinese: 在thanksgiving买了一些东西.买了一个域名.clinique打75折满65送full size的一个产品. 下了2单. 收到两封邮件, 一单已经发货, 一单的full size产品没有了. 花了一个小时打电话给客服追加新的优惠满65得到额外的6 piece. 昨天收到了发货的包裹, 却没有full size产品.在zara网站看中了一条裙子, 第二天去里. 店员说卖完了. 就逛zara, 买了2件衣服. これとこれ。打算做一个关于中文和日文的网站。周日周一写了script， 周一晚上做了slides。等制作完成后， 希望大家能看一下ビデオを 見て お願いします。 2017/12/06 WednesdayJapanese: ゆうめなanime kill la kill を 見ました。好きでも嫌いでもないです。先生に 来[らい] 学期[がっき] の 教科書を聞きました。Japanese for Busy Peopleを 使[つか]います。Book I は 漢字が ない たった平仮名が あります。Book IIは 漢字と平仮名が あります。ankiに 入力する前に online 辞書で 単語[たんご] を探[さが]します。たくさん 時間を使[つか]っているから、新しい教科書が 嫌いです。 Chinese: 看完动漫kill la kill问老师下个学期用什么教科书.第一本书全部是hiragana,第二本书才开始有kanji. 希望书里还是要有kanji“…To reduce the burden on busy learners, vocabulary and grammar has been limited to about a third of that typically introduced in beginners courses…”中国人学习有汉字的教科书会更快. 如果学第一本书， 在输入anki之前，所有的词汇都需要重新查online字典， 确定汉字。anki里别人根据这本书制作的deck都是hiragana， 这让我觉得很scary。若真的有人把hiragana的单词全部背下来， 就真的只能说， 而不能读。 只会说不会读，那是文盲。 2017/12/13Japanese 私は 最近

HTMlとCSSとJavascriptとjQueryを 教えるている覚えるけど JavascriptのDOMや aJaxや CSSのanimationなど强调用はがありませんでした。でも、私は 少し 知識で いくつか①のfont-end websitesを 作りました。 私は毎日 一時間の練習がに 適[てき]する③ と思います。blogで 記録[きろく]するので、 blogの使用[しよう]⓪の 惯用语句回数[かいすう]③が 増加[ぞうか]しいます。たくさん人が 記録を賞賛[しょうさん]⓪して とても楽しいです。３人が 私からに因为是被动， 方向改变 １００日のchallengeを始めるのを吹き込[ふきこ]まれる触発され と言っていました。 A is suitable for B (Aが) (Bに) 適[てき]する 毎日 一時間の練習は 私に 適[てき]する③ と思います。 Chinese: 少量的知识足够完成有意思的作品。去年12月开始做100天chanllenge。 freecodecamp教HTMl，CSS，Javascript和jQuery。 但是教得不深。没有说明aJax.没有教css的animation.但我能用所学的一点点知识做出虽然style不好,但是符合我想法的front-end网站. 从中觉得每天限制1h的练习很适合我.每天记录在blog中也增加了我使用blog的频率.好多人在网上对我的blog发出赞扬. 超过3个人问我inspire他们开始做100天的challenge. 很开心. 学校的思维影响了我. 老师和知乎都会说牛人学知识系统.我们这些平凡人为了学知识而学知识. 2018/03/01 Thursday A tripJapanese: Philadephiaへの旅[たび]② 遊び: not travelling word 二年前の五月に 一人で Philadephiaに 遊び ました遊びに行きました。早く切符を買って買いので、一番安かったです。数か月前に megabusのウェブサイトで 買って、行くの切符と来るの切符が$\$$1だ。合計[ごうけい]⓪は $\$4$でした。午前 New Yorkから 6:50の出発[しゅっぱつ]⓪で、8:50font color=”blue”&gt;に到着[とうちゃく]⓪しました。 午後 Philadephiaから 7:10の出発で 9:20に到着しました。 8:50に到着[とうちゃく]⓪しました8:50到着でした。 visitor center[ビジターセンター]前で 乗リました。visitor centerの中に お土産の店があって、写真をたくさん 撮りました。だから、何も買いませんでした。物より 写真は もっと 思いて追憶[ついおく]◎が あります。特[とく]に①、すべての写真は 数秒の動画があって、動画には 声があります。 写真はもっと 思いてに なります。 には 包含部分要用に Drafts: mix of Chinese, Japanese 遠足 提早好几个月从megabus买票. 买到了往返都是$\$$1的最低票. 去6:50-8:50am, 回来7:10-9:20pm. 总价$\$4$. 早く切符を買いので、一番安かったです。一人で Philadephiaに 遊びました。 我在费城的visitor center下车。お土産の店に 写真をたくさん 撮りました。だから、何も買いませんでした。 照片比实体物品保存更多的记忆， 尤其是， iphone的每张照片有动的video。喜欢video超过了图片，因为几秒钟的video有声音， 会动。 拍了一些广景图片， 记录眼睛视觉看到的范围最好的方式。普通的照片能拍到的范围太小。 独立纪念馆自由钟 看到有人绣过期. 问了下那个时期美国人女性地位, 和中国一样,也是非常低的. 2层观光巴士上， 听导游做讲解。 U.S.的铸币厂周末没有开门.好遗憾啊. 中午去费城的唐人街吃小笼包(6个), 生煎包(6个), 1碗酸辣汤.全部是我爱吃的, 吃得好饱, 好开心. 在纽约很少吃小笼包, 在美国第一次吃生煎包, 外卖里经常有酸辣汤. 去U Pen参观, 特别还去了Watson商学院. 从外表看还是很一般, 真正厉害的是人而非建筑物. 在路上碰到了很多学生穿着学士服一起合拍, 他们的家长也来了. 当我往回去的megabus的车站走, 才知道当天U Pen在体育馆举行毕业典礼.体育场外, 排了一条条的队, 等待进场. 地上满是水的瓶子. U Pen的建筑风格与哥大和哈佛一样, 我猜是不是所有Ivy League都是一个建筑风格.在网上查了下,8所学校建于1636-1764年间, 他们的年龄比中华人名共和国的年龄长多了. 哈佛是最老的, 建于清号初期皇太极时期. U Pen建于1740年, 乾隆时期. 差点误了上车地点, 跑了10分钟到车站. 2018/03/15 Thursday1. Tell me about a good movie you enjoyed. Summary of the storyline + your thoughts.Japanese: pixaが ２０１５に Inside Outのアニメを 作りました。 IMDB 8.2/10 Rotten Tomatoes 98% douban 8.7/10 １１歳女の子Rileyは 両親と 一緒に アメリカの$\stackrel{\text{ちゅうおう}}{央}$から$\stackrel{\text{せいぶ}}{西部}$①に $\stackrel{\text{ひっこ}}{引越}$しをしました。このアニメは 新しい家に 彼女の頭の五気持ちの話しでした。 五$\stackrel{\text{きほん}}{基本}$の気持ちは 皆さんの頭に あります。 JoyとSadnessとFearとDisgustとAnger。引越し前に Joyは 気持ちのリーダーで、楽しい事後に $\stackrel{\text{ちょうき}}{長期}$$\stackrel{\text{きおく}}{記憶}$に いい経験を あげました。$\stackrel{\text{きおく}}{記憶}$には 両親とスキーするや アイスホッケーの試合や いい友達と遊びなとがありました。 新しい家と学校に入る後に、Joyは Rileyが楽しい経験をもらうのが 欲しいので、いつも Sadnessと$\stackrel{\text{べつ}}{別}$の気持ちと $\stackrel{\text{え}}{選}$り$\stackrel{\text{わ}}{分}$けました。間違いご、JoyとSadnessが $\stackrel{\text{ちゅうすうしんけい}}{中枢神経}$⑤を 出って、$\stackrel{\text{のう}}{脳}$①の別の$\stackrel{\text{ぶい}}{部位}$①に 入りました。3気持ちを$\stackrel{\text{あま}}{余}$すのが Rileyの気持ちを $\stackrel{\text{かんり}}{管理}$しました。気持ちの$\stackrel{\text{こんらん}}{混乱}$⓪だから、Rileyは お母さんから クレジットカードを $\stackrel{\text{ぬす}}{盗}$んで、$\stackrel{\text{こきょう}}{故郷}$①にの切符を 買いました。その時、Joyが $\stackrel{\text{とくべつ}}{特別}$のメモリを 見ました。Rileyのアイスホッケーの試合の$\stackrel{\text{しっぱい}}{失敗}$後に、両親が 彼女を $\stackrel{\text{なぐさ}}{慰}$めました。そして、彼女は $\stackrel{\text{どうじ}}{同時}$に 幸福と$\stackrel{\text{かな}}{悲}$しみを 持っていました。Joyは Sadenessが 悪い気持ちじゃなかったと思って、Sadnessと 仲直りしました。Rileyは Sadenessを持ち後に、バースを 降りて、家に帰りました。両親は Rileyと同じ気持ちを 持っている と言っていました。 $\stackrel{\text{さいご}}{最後}$①、１以上の気持ちは 同じ用事に $\stackrel{\text{きょうりょく}}{協力}$して、Rileyも もっと いい経験になりました。 ところで歌の名前がBundle of Joyだの音楽が 大好きです。 何か勉強しました。 動画には $\stackrel{\text{ちょうき}}{長期}$$\stackrel{\text{きおく}}{記憶}$と$\stackrel{\text{ちゅうしょう}}{抽象}$が$\stackrel{\text{うつ}}{写}$っていました。 人は $\stackrel{\text{どうじ}}{同時}$に １以上の気持ちを持っています。 Sadnessは 悪い気持ちじゃないです。 drafts Inside Out 是pixa2015年出的动画片. IMDB 8.2/10 Rotten Tomatoes 98% douban 8.7/10 11岁的Riley小女孩随父母从美国中部搬到了西部. 讲述了搬到新家后, 她脑中的5种情绪的变化的故事. 整个故事假设人有5种基本情绪, 快乐, 难过, 嫉妒, 愤怒, 害怕. 在Riley小时候, 她的快乐情绪占主导地位. 经历了快乐的事情后, joy会把记忆发送到long-term memory. 这些记忆包括与父母一起溜冰, 参加冰球比赛获胜, 与好朋友一起玩. Riley搬到新家和进入新学校后, joy一直尽量把sadness困在一个小范围, 尽量让在适应新环境的过程中感到快乐. 一次操作失误, joy和sadness被吸进了中枢神经以外的大脑区域. 大脑中其他3种情绪在joy和sadness缺席的情况下, 控制着Riley的情绪. 后来Riley的情绪到达临界点, 她偷了妈妈的信用卡买车票回中部. 这时候, joy看到了过去的一段回忆, 当Riley比赛失败的时候, 父母安慰她, 最终Riley同时体验了joy和sadness两种情绪. 这让joy意识到sadness并不是一种不好的情绪. Riley体验到悲伤后, 她下了车后回了家. 父母和Riley聊天说他们搬到新环境也感到悲伤. 最后, 多种情绪在同一件事情上开始了合作, 让Riley在体验情绪的同时, 增加了很多经验和能力. 学习到了 形象地表你回了long-term memory, 抽象思维 同一时刻, 人能同时体验多种情绪. sadness并不是不好的情绪 2. If you have to choose only one language to use for the rest of your life, what will it be? And why.Japanese: $\stackrel{\text{ぼご}}{母語}$①が 中国語です。しかし、一言葉を$\stackrel{\text{えら}}{選}$ぶ②なら、英語を$\stackrel{\text{えら}}{選}$びます。 アメリカは $\stackrel{\text{こうよう}}{公用}$語が 英語です。色々な文化がある アメリカの文化は $\stackrel{\text{かんぜん}}{完全}$じゃないです。でも、結構です。 英語で 最新の科学のニュースを 知ります。 たとえ言葉を 知らない としても、外国人と 話します。韓国人やイタリ人やIndianなどがらります。皆さん 一緒に 英語を 話します。 drafts 虽然我的母语是中文, 但若只能选一种语言, 我会选英文. 我喜欢美国的多文化的包容. 虽然无法100%人种,文化平等, 但我已经很满足了. 会接触到最新的科学进步发展. 能直接和世界上讲各个不同语言的人交流. 因为他们也会说英语, 而不是说中文. 2018/03/291. Tell me about a skill set that you don’t think you’ll ever acquire, but admire. (ballet, leather shoe making…etc)Japanese: 中学から日本の漫画が好きです。でも、$\stackrel{\text{えが}}{描}$くのがちょっとつまらなくて、漫画家は$\stackrel{\text{くなん}}{苦難}$な職業です。大抵の日本の漫画雑誌は$\stackrel{\text{げっかん}}{月刊}$$\stackrel{\text{し}}{誌}$で、漫画家が月に２０から４０までページを描きます。私が$\stackrel{\text{しゅうかんし}}{週刊誌}$の漫画家を$\stackrel{\text{かんし}}{感心}$します。彼らが毎週２０ページを描くから。SLAM DUNKとバガボンドを描いた$\stackrel{\text{いのうえ たけひこ}}{井上 雄彦}$の$\stackrel{\text{きろくえいが}}{記録映画}$を見ました。井上さんは 締め切りひに $\stackrel{\text{すいみん}}{睡眠}$ $\stackrel{\text{ほじゅう}}{補充}$しまして、一週間 $\stackrel{\text{ものがたり}}{物語}$ と思いまして、 とても 悩みでした。締切日の1日の前、$\stackrel{\text{ものがたり}}{物語}$を 決めまして、すべてのアシスタント 一緒に $\stackrel{\text{てつや}}{徹夜}$して描きました。 $\stackrel{\text{とがし よしひろ}}{冨樫義博}$が 幽☆遊☆白書を描く時に 毎週 ２０時間 寝た と言っていました。そして、$\stackrel{\text{ようつう}}{腰痛}$持って始まりました。 バクマンの漫画が 漫画を描くのが$\stackrel{\text{か}}{賭}$け事だ と言っていました。大抵の漫画は 雑誌で $\stackrel{\text{しかく}}{資格}$がありません。 drafts 画漫画 我从初中开始非常喜欢看漫画. 画画本身是个有点枯燥的活动. 漫画家也是个很苦的职业. 漫画杂志是月刊, 也就是一个月画10-30页不等. 我很佩服周刊杂志的画家, 每周要20张. 看过井上雄彦的纪录片. 交稿日当天补觉, 整个一周在想故事, 作者非常焦虑, 到截稿前面一天, 才确定内容开始画, 所有助手一起熬夜通宵画才赶上.富坚义博当当年连载一周只睡20个小时. 他得了腰痛的毛病.食梦者的漫画里说画漫画就像赌博.大多数的漫画被腰斩, 或者连出现在杂志上的资格都没有. 真的好佩服日本漫画家们 2. What do you miss the most about China while living in the US私は 上海の朝ご飯に 会いたいです。 一番大好きで ちょっと 高い サンチンポです。アメリカで あまり 本物の上海のサンチンポがありません。アメリカの店が作るのが 大きくて、$\stackrel{\text{かわ}}{皮}$が$\stackrel{\text{あつ}}{厚}$くて、$\stackrel{\text{しる}}{汁}$がありません。 二番会いたいの食べ物は 杂酱面で、とても 安いです。中学と高校に よく 食べまして、大学は$\stackrel{\text{こうがい}}{郊外}$があったので、たまたま食べました。アメリカで 全然 会いません。 drafts 我想念上海的早餐。 我最喜欢的但有点小贵的生煎包。在美国很少有正宗的上海生煎包。 美国店里做的生煎包很大皮厚，底不焦，没有汁。 第二想念的是白玉兰的杂酱面, 非常便宜。初中的时候经常吃。高中吃得少， 大学在郊区就吃不到了。在国内，我只在白玉兰吃到这种面。在美国一次都没有碰到过。 2018/05/31 Thursday1. What would you ask your future self and what would you tell the 10 year old you. (use advise, permission TE forms)私は今 未来がなるのことを知りません。だから、未来の毎日は $\stackrel{\text{げんざい}}{現在}$にいたほうがいいです。世界の$\stackrel{\text{ふびょうどう}}{不平等}$に $\stackrel{\text{おこ}}{怒}$りないで、今のことを変更します。 子供$\stackrel{\text{じだい}}{時代}$は お父さんの$\stackrel{\text{きょういく}}{教育}$の方法を信じらないでもいいです。 drafts 现在不知道将来会怎么样. 希望将来的自己能时刻把握当下. 对于世界的不平等, 能平静接受，努力去做自己能改变的. 想告诉10岁的自己, 爸爸关于教学方面的知识不适合我, 不要相信他 爸爸曾经教过成人数学, 但这不代表他自己认为的那样教小孩子. 他小时候用碑帖练习书法, 因此他的自很死板,不灵动. 应该要用 爸爸的说法是错的. 读书不是只有背书. 爸爸说他喜欢数学, 他根本不知道大学数学是什么样的. 他经常去学校, 但不代表他就真的仔细和老师讨论对我如何教学了.不要依赖他的建议. 他买的世界名著不适合小学生读. 不要和他每周去书店, 而是去图书馆. 书非借而不能读. 2. where would you like to live when you are 80, and why. (だから、なので）80岁まで $\stackrel{\text{い}}{生}$きるのことが 信じらないから、80岁の生活に $\stackrel{\text{きたい}}{期待}$していません。 あの時、$\stackrel{\text{ようご}}{養護}$$\stackrel{\text{ろうじん}}{老人}$ホーム または 病院に 住むから、友達一緒に住むのがいいです。 drafts 因为我不觉得自己能活到80岁, 我对80岁的生活没有任何的期待. 会预测到时自己会住在养老院或者医院里. 若能有朋友住在同一家公司就好了。 2018/06/14 Thursday先週は 何かの事をする つもりでしたが、週末にパートを やりました。 火曜日に markdownに senteでの$\stackrel{\text{しょうせつ}}{小説}$を$\stackrel{\text{にゅうりょく}}{入力}$しました。 ankiで 新しい単語を 覚えなっかたで、quipとAnkiに 日本語の教科書の中のノートを$\stackrel{\text{にゅうりょく}}{入力}$しなかった。 nvaltsの中の２８５個ノートを$\stackrel{\text{さくじょ}}{削除}$しまして よかったです。 今月は 私の誕生日の月です。火曜日に banana republicが 与える ＄１５ gift cardで ソックスを 買いましたて sephoraに プレゼントを 貰いました。 月曜日は facebookのストックを $\stackrel{\text{う}}{売}$りまして $\$$196.2 (20.5%) を$\stackrel{\text{かせ}}{稼}$ぎまして 今日は Etsyのストックを 買いました。 drafts 上周订了计划,虽然没有在周末完成, 却在本周完成了部分. 把sente里所有的小说网上找到文件, 输入markdown file. 打算anki背新的单词, 没有成功. 日语书上的notes输入quip&amp;Anki, 没有做 nvalts里的notes删掉285个 周二使用banana republic赠送的$15的gift card买了袜子.领取sephora的礼物 周一卖了facebook股票, 赚了196.2. 20.5% profit 今天买了Etsy的股票。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Behavioral Activation for Depression (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-of-Behavioral-Activation-for-Depression-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will decide to do/not to do things based on behavioral activation for depression. Start Date: 2017-12-12 The goal is to be in control. The challenge is very personal and very important for me. I asked several therapists before about whether I had depression or not and none of them gave me a direct answer. Finally, a therapist who uses CBT told me that I had depression and my symptom was typical. I felt relieved and can focus on how to treat depression. When I did not get confirmed the answer, I felt frustrated and did not know the goal of the therapy and the criteria for recovery. The method was taught by the CBT therapist. The goal is to be in control. Before I decide to do/do not do things, I will ask myself whether they will increase depression after doing them. If they decrease depression or keep the depression level the same with before, they can be done. The method is easily incorporated into my thinking style but it is not a habit. The goal of making the challenge is to make it a habit. Changing thinking style is very different from skills like coding, drawing, reading paper. Then the rules will be different. Rules I will try to use it when I make decision on the project level. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Whether I use it or not, I must record here. Milestones 1 Day 1 (2017-12-12 Tuesday) 7 Days (2018-01-04 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions:*** Morning* Afternoon* Evening&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-12 Tuesday Afternoon open mailbox deal with letters activate 2 cards pay utility bill write today’s CBT session notes Evening bath face scrub face mask Day 2: 2017-12-13 Wednesday Morning have lunch Afternoon work web development project for only one hour Evening recite Japanese words on Anki Day 3: 2017-12-14 Thursday Morning study web develpmenent tutorials for only one hour Day 4: 2018-01-01 MondayI resumed recording anti-depressant behavior activation for depression. Though the method is close to my thinking style, I do not use it automatically so far. I want to develope this skill. Morning: When I lay on the bed this morning, getting up became a difficult thing. I told myself I would regret. Afternoon: I did not use the anti-depressant behavior activation as a rule to do things. I did recall my action of lying on the bed and thought about the it. Evening: The same with afternoon. Now it is 9 p.m.. I want to relax and told myself I would increase depression tomorrow if I did it. Day 5: 2018-01-02 Tuesday Rewrote the post to fit 100 Days of Chanllenge style. Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning The same with yesterday. The temperature was cold and I did not want to get up. Even if I used the method, the anti-dpressant behavior activation does not help. I used the remote to open my small heater. I got up even if I knew it was still cold outside and the heater would not warm the whole room. Afternoon Around 3:40 p.m., I felt anxious and wanted to open music as a background noise. I told myself it would increase depression if I did that. Then I opened the Markdown file of the challenge and started writing introduction, rules, and goals, and formatting the challenge. Evening Bath Mask Day 6: 2018-01-03 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I haven’t been to the office for two weeks. If I do not go to the office, it will increase depression If I go to the office, not doing data analysis will increase depression. The conclusion: whether I go to the office or not will increase depression 😢 Outcome: I chose a different walking path to the office. Depression hit me several times during walking. Because the roads are not clean or organized. I did one-hour data analysis. My emotion is ok. Working long hours will increase depression. Afternoon I brought KitKat to the office. If I eat KitKat as lunch, depression will increase. Evening I did not use the technique. All activities at night have been done for several days. I can activate them without much willpower. Day 7: 2018-01-04 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning: The therapist’s assistant left a voice mail to me at 8 a.m. and cancelled the today’s session. I did not listen to it until the subway started. The chain on the left boot was broken. I decided to return home and go to Macy’s to buy one pair. After one hour, I felt depression and wanted to go home. But there was one mall left. I asked myself whether I felt bad about myself if I skipped the mall. The answer was yes. Even if I did not feel happy, I pushed myself to do it. Afternoon Depression remained in the afternoon. I was working on freecodecamp 100 days challenge of coding accompanied by depression. Occasionally I asked my roommates which graph she like. It improved my mood. Evening I used the whole night to read Hugo tutorials and started to make a Hugo theme. I did not finish some 100-day challenges and had mixed feeling. On the one hand, solving one of the most concerned technology problems I have recently gave me joy. On the other hand, not doing 100-day challenges increased the stress level. Day 8: 2018-01-05 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed. I decided to make a website about projects for beginners even if I know that not doing 100-day challenges would increase the stress level. But if I proposponed making the website, the stress level would increased, too. I cannot forget the ideas. There is no solution for the situation. Afternoon I thought of Behavioral Activation for Depression, but no decision was decided based on it. Evening I thought about it intensely when I bathed. I have several things that I am reluctant to do. If I do not do them, then depression ≥will increase. If I order the tasks on to-do lists from the least resistance to the highest resistance, then I do it in reverse order. Will it a good method to solve the situation? Day 9: 2018-01-06 SaturdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed to use iPad to search online. Even if I regret, the ideas/contents I searched online remain in my mind if I did not do that. Afternoon I started to implement ideas from yesterday’s night. I listed todos from I want to do most to least willing to do. Then the items were reversed by order. I started to do from the top. I procrastinated to start doing until 5 p.m.. If I start from the items I enjoy most, I will start around noon. After doing them, I enjoyed the process and worried about the slow progress. Evening I am happy I made small toy examples. When considering there are more things needed to be done, I stressed out. Behavioral Activation for Depression does not help in the situation. Day 10: 2018-01-07 SundayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I searched some stuff lying in bed. Afternoon I did not use the method. Evening I pushed myself to do challenge. Day 11: 2018-01-08 MondayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning It happens. Afternoon It does not happen. Evening I planned to write codes for one hour. But I overdid it and spent 3 hours. I went to sleep after 3 a.m.. I should not continue to do it even if the projects gave me fulfillment at that time. 福祸相依. Blessings and misfortunes are next-door neighbors. Day 12: 2018-01-09 TuesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning regret and stress Afternoon I did the projects in my mind. But I still feel stressful. Evening I pushed myself to be on track of doing challenges. Otherwise I will feel bad tomorrow. I spent several minutes on watching music. Even if I enjoyed the process, I regretted. Day 13: 2018-01-10 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Getting up Thinking “if I do not get up, it will increase depression” does not help me get up but increase stress. If I think the most next action of getting up, it works. Afternoon I did not use the technique but wrote the notes for the morning Evening I planned to make a project related 100 days of challenge. I did not feel good about it. Every time I thought of it, the stress increased. I finally decided to give up. This is an extremely good decision. Day 14: 2018-01-11 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Yeserday I was too excited to get Grow with Google Challenge scholarship. I slept more than usual. Afternoon My roommate helps me made the decision. I do not like to be judged based on how active I am in the forum. But it is the onlhy way to get Google round 2 scholarship. If I push myself to reply at least 5 posts everyday, it will increase my stress and depression level every day. It is hard to give up, but I did it. Evening Record Day 15: 2018-01-12 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning get up Afternoon Made decision I worked on Udacity tutorial for only one hour. I use willpower to convince myself that I should not compare with other students. Some students start to do the 11th section, almost end of the Udacity course. Their fast progress give me a lot of pressure. I won’t be happy if I spend the whole day to learn one tutorial. makeup I did not want to do makeup. I used the method to push me to do it. Evening I overdid programming for R package. I planned one hour. It’s over two hours. The method stopped me. Day 16: 2018-01-13 SaturdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I did not wake up until 11 a.m.. There is no morning Afternoon Even though I knew that grocery shopping would disrupt the rhythm of my life, I had to do it because soical interaction took time. Evening I started 100-day challenge around 10 p.m.. I forgave myself for being late and just began to do it. Day 17: 2018-01-14 SundayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning nothing Afternoon I did not need this technique to start working on 100-day challenge. But thanks for it to help me at the beginning. Evening I regretted watching Zhihu and musci MV, and ate chocolates. Day 18: 2018-01-15 MondayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning nothing Afternoon Just do it. Evening Crashed because of pressure. I do not feel happy even if I finished the course provided by Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. Day 19: 2018-01-16 TuesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Did data analysis until 4 a.m. Afternoon If there is no timer to work for one hour per subject. Recalling the past made me feel I was wasting time at that time. Evening I noticed my doing things slow because I am absorbed in my mind. I did not use the technique but started doing one of the challenges. I wanted me to do more because I will decrease the pressure when I recall today’s life.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will code to do data analysis for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-11 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. RulesModification (2018-01-05): I found The 5-Day Data Challenge in Kaggle today . I like Data Challenge better than Data Analysis with R. The title of the post was changed from 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R (Round 1) to 100 Days Of Data Challenge (Round 1). Even though no one tweets #100daysOfData, I want to use it. I will code using R or do data analysis with other software (such as Python) for at least an hour every day. Projects are counted towards the challenge: statistical analysis projects in my work projects from dissertation competitions, such as Kaggle Activties are counted towards the challenge: understand datasets in excel import data into R clean data write codes to do exploratory analysis and apply statistical model write statistical reports Activities are not counted towards the challnege: write emails to clients meet with clients/supervisors I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode, #100daysOfData and #100DaysOfDataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfDataScience challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfDataScience every day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log1234567891011### Day : **Link**: [Github Repo]() | [Project :]()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2017-12-17 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): import data into R Thoughts and Emotions The column name is messy after the data was imported into R. Thinking of the idea that I have to rename all columns one by one, I feel scared. Today I learned parts of tidyverse package in Lynda.com. I thought it was a good package. When I start using it, I missed the old method. But when I saw base R converted all character variables into factor variable after import, I missed tidyverse. I had mixed feelings about both base R and tidyverse. Day 2: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One hour work Cleaned the dataset column by column Wrote a Markdown table to record Thoughts and Emotions I did not finish the cleaning. I know cleaning is faster if I use SAS. I know the one hour work is not productive. But it gave me less pressure. I set a one-clock timer. I can feel that when it was approaching one hour, the stress level increased. Every time I work long hour until burning out, it will make it harder to start work next time. My goal is not the speed or productivity but consistency. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 3: 2018-01-05 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I created a R package project for beginners on RSnippets.com. It is to build a utility package for personal usage. I started to make one. Thoughts and Emotions I did not do this challenge again. The small project can get me started. This is the reason I did a project for beginners, not a big project. I feel good at the end of one-hour session. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 4: 2018-01-06 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read the post about how changing location will affect the linear regression result. Reproduce the example from Sean I created 2 toy examples: $y = 0.2x$ $y = 0.2x+x^2$ $x$ is uniform(-0.5,0.5). $x$ in the program means uniform(0,1). If the true model is linear The above graph shows fitted models look almost the same when the location of $x$ is changed. The above graph shows the intercept will decrease when the location of $x$ becomes bigger. This conforms to the mathematical proof. $$y = 0.2x = (0.2-0.2a) + (x+0.2a)$$ $0.2-0.2a$ is the intercepts after $x$ moves. It has the linear relationship with $a$. However, in theory, the coefficient of $x$ remains the same. In fact, it changes a little bit. If the true model is non-linear The above two graphs show that the location has big impact on cofficients for non-linear models. Around 800 and -800, lm fails to estimate a coefficient for the quadratic term, &amp; gives a warning about a singular design matrix. The relationship between intercept and location is not linear anymore. In summary, if the scale of predictors is big, such as over 800, it is a good choice to center them first before performing any data analysis.

I feel bad that they were supposed to take less time. Tomorrow’s plan Read online posts about normalized data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 5: 2018-01-15 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Data analysis for over 3 hours. Thoughts and Emotions The most accomplished thing is to find how to reduce variables required to be created or reduce the number of global variables. When fitting each model, I have to create intermediate variables, such as a variable fit to keep the information of fitted models. Every time, I have to think hard to give each variable a different name, or make sure I run all code if the same variable names are reused. The intermediate variables are all global variables. It is the user’s responsibility to delete unused variables. It is worse that variables like i or j created at the beginning of the loop are not temporary variables! Now I found a solution: use with function. Let me use iris dataset as an example. By the way, iris is a global variable name for the dataset. Very bad practice. 12345678&gt; head(iris) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa For example, I want to fit two logistic models. They include different independent variables. Model 1 uses length and width while Model 2 uses width only. 1234567891011121314# Model 1fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50))summary(fit)# Model 2fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50))summary(fit) Two models used the same variable to fit to save the information from glm. fit is a global variable. In fact, fit is an intermediate variable and is not useful at the end of data analysis. This is also the reason to reuse it in a different model. It is a poor coding style. I have several choices. Use a different name for fit for different models. Usually, I will fit a lot of models during data analysis. Keeping track of the model fit requires patience. Set fit as a local variable in a function Write a function for each model? The same problem exists as above: keeping track of the function requires patience. Set fit as a local variable within with function. My choice. Let me rewrite the code. with(iris, { fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50)) print(summary(fit)) } ) with(iris, { fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50)) print(summary(fit)) }) The fit variable in each with function will not affect each other. It will disappear when with ends. Excellent! Tomorrow’s plan Meeting Refine Future’s plan Read source code of Relaxed Lasso’s R package Day 6: 2018-01-29 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Thoughts and Emotions I am happy that I created a website for my statistical notes. One drawback is that any knowledge whatever how small it is will take time to write. When I copy the code from the notebook to do data analysis, I feel the time spent is worthwhile. It is a delimma. People usually think we should write functions to reduce the reduandancy code. A lot of code in data analysis is used only once or will be different a little bit every time. Tomorrow’s plan meeting Day 7: 2018-02-01 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Thoughts and Emotions In recent years, I paid attention to reproducible research, i.e, reproducible report. Or it means whether the code can produce the same result after several years. The answer usually is “No”. There is only one reason: we cannot know whether the future packages/R version used now will be modified to be so differently from the current version or whether they stop maintainence and cannot be compatible with future version of other packages. Let me simplify the problem. Assume the failure rate of each package follows binomial distribution with probability of $p$. $p$ is the same for all packages. If I use n packages in a data analysis project, the probability of code can be reproduced in the future is $(1-p)^n$. R itself can be considered as a package, too. $(1-p)^n$ becomes smaller if $n$ increases; more packages in the research decrease the possibility of reproducibility. Tomorrow’s plan meeting Day 8: 2018-02-02 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Thoughts and Emotions To reduce the number of packages used, I plan to write some small snippets code in with() function to create characteristic table. Tomorrow’s plan Take notes Day 9: 2018-02-04 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Thoughts and Emotions It is hard to get started. I start reading the textbook Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed which is the book for my master program. I feel warm from the book and optimistic about the statistics study. I used the table template from my first published paper and constructed the table on the current project. It gave me a lot of encouragement because it seemed close to publication if the same amount time was spent. Day 10: 2018-02-06 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Thoughts and Emotions I was absorbed in doing data analysis + making tables. Making a satisfying table is time-consuming. It can take as much time as creating models with R. I am annoyed by the repeated boring work, such as making tables. The solution is to play music in the background. Background music is a must for the mind to be absorbed in data analysis because there is a lot of tedious stuff in the process. Tomorrow’s plan Copy output from RStudio to excel to make 3 tables Day 11: 2018-02-06 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): data analysis Made 3 tables Rereead a paper from others Reread a paper from the cooperators Thoughts and Emotions I cleaned over 300 emails on medical center’s email inbox. It is boring work. As I said yesterday, the background music is a must for the scenario. Otherwise, “impatience” and intolerable emotion arose. I was amazed that I finished the things planned yesterday. These two days, I am in the zone though depression sometimes attacked me. Tomorrow’s plan Meet advisor Hopefully I can start write the “Method” part of the paper Day 12: 2018-02-22 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Ran and edited code one year ago Thoughts and Emotions The old code missed two functions. I have to rewrite. Tomorrow’s plan Continue Day 13: 2018-02-23 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Found the mistakes why the old code did not work Thoughts and Emotions One typo caused error! Tomorrow’s plan Rerun the code and write code to achieve the latest need based on the old code Day 14: 2018-02-26 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Run code Found another error Thoughts and Emotions I was so happy that code could run again. All models produced the same with results in the last year’s report, except the previous model. The anxiety increased because of fear that I cannot find the bug. Tomorrow’s plan Look for the reason why the last model gives different result. Day 15: 2018-03-01 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Found the error why parts of code generated different results Met supervisor Thoughts and Emotions This week is so busy. After rereading the code, I found the reason was the data deleted by complete.cases function in R. If we use only 3 variables, then complete.cases function should be applied to the dataset containing 3 variables, not to the whole data. After correcting, happily, the result is the same as last year’s report. Tomorrow’s plan Format tables Transform data with logarithm and run Day 16: 2018-06-04 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 2 hour codingThoughts and Emotions Before doing things, thinking increased anxiety. Thinking more, more anxiety. When doing, it was not that difficult. Day 17: 2018-06-05 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 2 and half coding and writing Thoughts and Emotions Today has a good state. I can fully focus on doing things. Day 18: 2018-06-28 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Coding and writing Thoughts and Emotions Redo the analysis and hate typing the results into the word document because of tedius work. Day 19: 2018-07-05 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Coding and writing Thoughts and Emotions I have big progress today. Foward and backward stepwise logistic regression is usually used to select variables. The odds ratio are in the results. However, there are variables which are not significant in the final model. The reason is that stepwise uses AIC and fitting models use loglikelihood. All people in stackexchange recommended to use Lasso instead of stepwise. However, the coefficient generated by Lasso cannot be interpreted as odds ration. My conclusion: there is no perfect answer so far. Day 20: 2018-11-28 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Wrote R code to download dividend 1:56:55 Wrote R code to calculate dividend 0:20:35 Thoughts and Emotions A lot of functions of Google Finance in Google sheets are broken. I have to use R to collect stock information. Day 21: 2018-11-04 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Wrote R code to calcluate ratio and order by ratio decreasingly. Thoughts and Emotions A milestone to achieve financial independence! Day 22: 2018-11-05 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Edited R code because dataset is changed Day 23: 2018-11-10 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Wrote R code to get beta Day 24: 2018-11-16 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Edited R code for transaction Day 22: 2018-11-27 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Reran the code Checked results Edited code to change graphs Thoughts and Emotions I feel good. I wrote the code four months ago and can understand the meaning now. I started to use Toggl to track time. It is a fantastic tool.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Japanese (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary. Start Date: 2017-12-10 BackgroundI learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher’s experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. Rules I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from Genki books and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfJapanese and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #Anki #Japanese challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #Anki #Japanese each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-10 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-16 Saturday) 30 Days (Day 30: 2018-02-21 Wednesday) 60 Days (Day 60: 2018-04-09 Monday) 90 Days (Day 90: 2018-08-14 Tuesday) 100 Days (Day 100: 2018-09-03 Monday) Thoughts after CompletionToday is 2018-09-10. I usually take a picture of Anki result by iPhone. After a while, I record several days in a batch. Hence, today is not the last day of 100 days, 2018-09-03. First, I am proud that this is the first 100-day challenge I finished. Even if I do not follow the rule strictly, it is still a fantastic achievement. Second, I have a lot of off-wagon time during this challenge and more off-wagon time in other challenges. In fact, the unwritten rule is that if I can resume doing what supposed to be done, the challenge continues to be effective. The rule is applied to all other challenges. One of the biggest off-time according to milestones is between Day 60: 2018-04-09 and Day 90: 2018-08-14. Four months (120 days) finished only 30 days. It is not good to focus on goals but focus on process. I hope I can get used to reciting more Japanese. Template for Log12345678### Day :**No. of Anki Cards**:**Time spent**:**Thoughts and Emotions:**&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-10 SundayNo. of Anki Cards: 292 Time spent: 34 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I cannot concentrate on review Anki cards. A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. There are only 4 tweets under #100DaysOfJapanese. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days. It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge. Day 2: 2017-12-11 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 313 Time spent: 36 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. #100DaysOfJapanese is not a right hashtag. People use #Anki #Japanese to indicate they use Anki to learn Japanese. Day 3: 2017-12-12 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 525 Time spent: 62 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: There are over 600 cards in the backlog. In recent days, I focus on reviewing old cards; no new cards.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will make projects to develope front-end develoment skill. Start Date: 2017-12-06 Rules I will code to make projects from FreeCodeCamp for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle #freecodecamp and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. My daily job is not related to front-end development. All time spent on working on web development will count towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle and #100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle #freecodecamp each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) Rule Updates 2018-01-11: I got Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship today. Hence, I added #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle to the hashtag list. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-06 Wednesday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-12 Monday) Day 18 (2017-12-25 Monday): Make the first personal project Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics and get over 10 stars on GitHub within one day 30 Days (2018-01-07 Sunday) 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Project list Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Project 7: visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph Project 8: Visualize Data with a Heat Map 2017-12-25 Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics 2017-12-26 Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List 2017-12-26 Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist 2018-01-05 Github Repo | Project 12: RSnippets.com 2018-01-08 Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator 2018-01-09 Github Repo | Project 14: Awesome Lifehack Calculators 2018-01-24 Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet 2018-02-19 Make a website for comics Insanely Reasonable Reasonably Insane Template for Log1234567891011### Day :**Link**: [Github Repo]() | [Project :]()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2017-12-06 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): finished the first project “Build a Tribute Page”. Thoughts and Emotions: I finished the tutorials of Bootstrap and jQuery. After that, I started the first project “Build a Tribute Page”. Zhuge Liang is a historical figure that I admire. I feel excited to make a tribute page to him. Today is the first time I use Bootstrap though I heard it a lot in the past. This tool is awesome. It’s an intense work. Luckily, all questions along the way were solved by myself. It took around 3 hours. Day 2: 2017-12-07 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started the second project “Personal Portfolio”. Worked on toggle button and scrollspy for at least 4 hours. Finally solved. Thank @keller0 Cai and @meitounaoqiao 殷蔚乔 for help in FreeCodeCamp/chinese. Thoughts and Emotions:I already have had a personal website, and my daily job is not website development. But I want to have a fancy project page. My purpose to do the “Personal Protolio” project is to list my projects in all fields I am interested in, such as data science, web development. In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it. Today is a tough day. “Personal Portfolio” is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses scrollspy and toggle button. There are some differences in scrollspy between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. I felt discouraged and wasted time. Then I decided to seek help online. This is a right decision. FreeCodeCamp/chinese is the channel most suitable for me. Reference: Scroll @Bootstrap 4 Scroll @Bootstrap 4 beta Navbar togglers Day 3: 2017-12-08 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): edit the first section add 100-DAY CHALLENGES section change Awesome Font Icon from 4 to 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I am a little bit depressed today. The whole day I searched one content on iPad lying in bed. At night I got up, had dinner, took a shower, and did laundry. And then I started resuming doing the yesterday’s work. Even if I made big progress yesterday, I spent almost all day to work the project. It is very bad. Other important things are pushed away, and this will increase my stress level. The result is that I will burn out more easily and the probability of quitting the 100-day challenge will increase. I promised myself at around 6 that I would do the project for one hour. To make it work, I set a timer. Sadly, I broke the promise and worked much longer than I promised. It is 3 a.m. now. Today I almost finished the 2nd project Personal Portfolio except for one problem: collapsable menu. This is an example from w3 school. When the screen is small, the menu is collapsed. When I open the menu, the menu is overlapped with the content below. I posted the question in the gitter of FreeCodeCamp. I will go to sleep and hope that the answer will appear tomorrow. Day 4: 2017-12-09 SaturdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): changed color scheme added jump to top button asked yesterday’s question in FreeCodeCamp forum because I got no answer in the gitter Finished Project 2: Personal Portfolio Thoughts and Emotions: I started coding at 12 a.m. because I spent a lot of time during the day in freeing up space for Mac Air to install Mac OS High Sierra. Initially, I planned to finish project 2 in one hour and spend two hours in fact. The final color scheme of the website still looks strange. After I learn following courses in FreeCodeCamp in the future, I can polish the website. Finishing one not-perfect product is better than a never-finish product. Day 5: 2017-12-10 SundayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Project 2 “Personal Portfolio” amendment added padding to the right of icons added icons in front of titles of sections Started Project 3 “Random Quote Machine” Thoughts and Emotions: There are lots of JavaScript tutorials before project 3 in freeCodeCamp. If I start projects until finishing tutorials, I will forget much knowledge I have learned so far, and it will be harder to continue 100DaysCoder challenge. I plan to complete CSS part of projects and started Javascript part until I studied all JavaScript tutorials. Today’s plan was 2-hour tutorial and 1-hour coding. Studying tutorials for 2 hours was as planned. However, I spent much more time in coding than one hour. It is hard to start and harder to stop. It happens to all aspects of my life. I do not know how to solve it. Happiness was generated when one-hour coding was completed. Stress increased as time came by after one hour. I am happy that I found a useful Atom plugin Auto-live-server . It refreshed the local webpage when web development related files are saved. There is one problem I asked in the gitter. Button’s border style is not consistent with different browsers. Here is my code. 12345678910button &#123; color: white; background-color: pink; box-shadow: 0; border:none;&#125;button:focus &#123; border:none;&#125; Chrome has a border around the button after I click it. Safari and codepen do not have the border. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3 Random Quotes Machine move CSS to main.css rethink how to structure css file adjust the width of border of quotes adjust the size of social media icons Project 2 Project Portolio look for a picture for Project 2 change Project 2 status from Ongoing to Complete add Project 3 and set it Ongoing create a new challenge Day 6: 2017-12-11 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): completed the plan set yesterday!! Project 2 Project Portolio move CSS to main.css move JavaScript to /scripts Styling using pure CSS takes a lot of time. Adding a graph is simpler and more beautiful. Thoughts and Emotions: Before learning in freecodecamp, I thought front-end development incorporated designing websites. I like coding part but not designing. Two parts are knitted together during the process of learning. Projects showing from other students in freecodecamp are more beautiful than my page. This made me feel bad. It is satisfying to change project status from “ongoing” to “complete” and add new projects to my project portfolio page. Again, when I started doing projects, it is hard to stop. Now is 12 a.m. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the html part of Project 4: the Local Weather for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Day 7: 2017-12-12 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on the todo list created yesterday. Thoughts and Emotions: It is the 7th day!! I have been doing this challenge for one week. It is the 2nd milestone 😃 Though HTML part of Project 4 is simpler than that of Project 3, I was amazed that I finished building it in one and half an hour including time of seeking help in gitter. The files of HTML and CSS are clean, and the logic of codes are clear. I am satisfied with what have been done today. I will start to code HTML part of Project 5 tomorrow. The project is cool because of both functionality and design. One hour per day is devoted to learning tutorials in FreeCodeCamp. The progress will be slow.

Don’t overdo. Add Project 4 to project page Thoughts and Emotions: The time spent on adding new projects to project page was longer than I expected. The list of projects is formatted by decks with Bootstrap 4. I feel the design is a little bit uncomfortable but don’t know why. At the end of today’s task, I asked the question in FreeCodeCamp forum. There is no time to touch project 5 today. It will be tomorrow’s task. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours. This makes me feel nervous. The best way to remove the negative emotion is to have a try. I did one algorithm and learned the format of algorithm scripting. The problems in the section are to use JavaScript array methods learned in the last section. Array methods are similar to Swift I learned 2 years ago. Even though I forgot the details of Swift, familiarity can help me learn counterparts in JavaScript.

Read answers in FreeCodeCamp forum. Day 9: 2017-12-14 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I read the reply to Personal Portfolio site feedback in FreeCodeCamp forum. The reply gave 6 points needed to improve. 5 points I solved today Make sure the items have a bit of space around them on smaller screens. On a mobile they go right to the edge of the screen, which looks a bit cramped. Solution: add padding: 80px to .section 123456section &#123; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px; box-shadow: 0px 2px rgb(160,160,160); padding: 80px;&#125; Make sure the images align - the ‘Ongoing’ header seems to push the image down a bit further than the ones on completed projects. Originally, I used &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw fa-2x&quot;&gt;. After deleting fa-2x, it became &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw&quot;&gt; and the problem solved. 123456&lt;span class="fa-layers fa-fw"&gt; &lt;div class="fa-3x"&gt; &lt;i class="fas fa-certificate text-danger"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="fa-layers-text fa-inverse text-warning" data-fa-transform="shrink-11.5 rotate--30 right-5"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The sections could do with a bit more vertical spacing at the bottom Solution: add padding: 80px to .section The same with the first one. It’s Code not Codes Solution: replace Codes with Code There’s a broken link to style.css Solution: delete the link 1 point I did not solve On intermediate screen sizes the items get very narrow - maybe reduce the number of items per row sooner Thoughts and Emotions: Making small adjustments or improvements to the website can take as much time as making one. I spent over 1 hour in correcting Project 2: Personal Portfolio only. It is a little bit discouraging because I have included starting Project 5 in tomorrow’s plan for two days, but there is no time left for this project.

Day 10: 2017-12-15 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started project 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I finally started Project 5. Among the only 5 projects, this is the first project which uses jQuery.

How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes? I will questions tomorrow in gitter. Thoughts and Emotions: Today is the toughest day. I struggle with several things in my personal life. During the day, I tried putting dynamic graphs generated by R package on the blog. There are no JavaScript library link and JavaScript code block containing data, then I cannot paste them to a Markdown or HTML file. R community including statistics community lacks good documentation and coding quality is poor. My knowledge of R never seems sufficient to find the solution to them. I feel constricted and frustrated all the time. Yesterday I thought I could finish the Basic Algorithm Script today. It is more difficult than I expected. If a function has lots of argument without argument name, use Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0) to get all arguments array.slice()‘s second argument is the end index - 1, not the number of characters to be sliced. I guess writing pseudocode before programming will help.

I did not follow the plan created on 2017-12-16 because I finished “Basic Algorithm Scripting” part (accumlatively around 7 hours) and started learning “JSON APIs and Ajax”. I want to apply the knowledge learned today to today’s work. I finished 5 things under Project 3 in Today’s progress. Each thing requires me searching online. They are not easy tasks for a newbie. Hence, they created a lot of frustration. I am a little bit discouraged by the slow process. When I thought of the fact that they were done in 1 hour, it created more hope.

Started “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” section. Within one hour, I finished items on the yesterday’s plan and addition plan. Thoughts and Emotions: It is fun. I like animation very much. Learning Making animation using Adobe Animator requires a lot of energy and time. Animation provided by JavaScript gives me enough joy, and its complexity is not overwhelming. In the future, I want to learn more. I like to create interactive graphs of data. It is also related to my major. Tomorrow I will start learning data visualization on the beta website and suspend “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” part until projects from data visualization are completed. After finishing Project 3, I will start data visualization projects. Joe Warren wrote a post on freeCodeCamp medium, How to Transform Your #100DaysOfCode Log Into a Visual Experience. He gave a lot of good advice on how to create a good log of 100 days challenge. He used his log as an example. In the comment, I asked whether he could give some advice on my log. He kindly gave me a long reply.

I like to read examples in the process of learning but Twitter API website has few examples. I am depressed today. I don’t know why. I spent a lot of time trying how to change the style of outputs from R notebook made by RStudio. A lot of time was spent on editing existing CSS file. At last, I found I did not need to touch any existing stylesheet. It is enough to create a new sheet and to include it after existing sheet. This is the fastest way to change the style from other people’s CSS.

Arrow functions from ES6 are taught in the Beta, not on the main website. I did not know the name of the function. When I searched closure function, tutorials online gave the normal functions. Then I asked this question in gitter. One person kindly answered it. I will learn arrow functions tomorrow first. I opened one issue on freecodecamp GitHub I used Chrome to do challenges. When the test did not pass, initially I thought the reason was that I did not know arrow functions. Then the code was copied to an empty HTML file. The bar plot was correctly shown. I guessed it was a browser issue and used Safari to run the same challenge. Safari passed my code. This made me confirmed that some code on the page on the website behaved differently between browsers. Update: After restarting the computer, chrome works, and then I closed the GitHub issue. My Mac Air was connected to an external monitor. After several days usage, it has some problems, such as Chrome. Restarting the laptop can solve them.

After learning all tutorials of data visualization, I will search online for the things not taught in FreeCodeCamp. Thoughts and Emotions: Learning data visualization is more boring than I expected. It seems more difficult than JavaScript because all functions are self-defined and sometimes do not conform standard JavaScript function construction rule. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Change project status Add new projects Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Day 18: 2017-12-25 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Changed colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine. Finished Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Thoughts and Emotions: @crossey on the gitter told me that colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine were not good. I guessed that colors were too vivid and eyes did not feel comfortable when seeing them. I found that most of the colors that had color names and beganb with “light” were suitable for eyes. Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List was a mardown README.md file. I will add gulp to create a website syncing with README.md.

The most time consuming part was to search GitHub, and to found the repos. There are 100 pages on GitHub about checklists. I used at least 5 hours to finish 100 pages. The process was boring. I am satisfied with Project 11. I will add styles after learning website design. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project portolio Change project status Add new projects Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Start JavaScript part Day 20: 2017-12-28 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on todo list designed the day before yesterday in one hour. Thoughts and Emotions: I did not use JavaScript for several days because I studied Data Visualization and did personal projects. Hard recall can lead to better memorization after several days. I am discouraged by the websites on my wishlist. They seem complicated. A lot of decisions should be made. Example: Which Front-End framework should be used? Static website or dynamic website? If I choose dynamic websites, which Back-End framework should I use? Where to save the photos? Photos and the website will be saved in different locations. If I choose static websites Which git website to use, GitLab or BitBucket? which deploy website should I use? In addition, I have to wait until I learn Back-End knowledge. Filling mind with undecided stuff is not a comfortable experience. Besides, even if I did projects for several days, they were not FreeCodeCamp project and then I need more willpower to initiate today’s work.

There is one error 1[Deprecation] getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition() no longer work on insecure origins. To use this feature, you should consider switching your application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. See https://goo.gl/rStTGz for more details. The corresponding code is following. 1234if (navigator.geolocation) &#123; navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) &#123; &#125;&#125; In fact, the code was shown in the tutorial on FreeCodeCamp.

Thoughts and Emotions: Yesterday, I did not know how to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius for the coding project and had a hard time to find the least common multiple of two numbers for the algorithm on FreeCodeCamp. They made me worry about today’s study. Writing my logic on paper help me finishing algorithm part. Writing the actions of clicking texts gave me a clear vision of how to toggle. Happily, I finished both of them. navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition is deprecated. Few answers on FreeCodeCamp forum mention it because websites hosted on a personal server or GitHub can meet the problem and most of the people put the project on CodePen. The solution is to use a free geo API from http://freegeoip.net/json/ instead of Google API. Tomorrow I will rewrite related codes.

Thoughts and Emotions: I used 1 day to finish HTML part and 6 days to complete JavaScript part of Project 4: the Local Weather. Each day one hour was spent on the project. Six days are too long and lost some interests. Thank myself for persisting working for one hour every day. Finally, the project is done.

Thoughts and Emotions: I spent several hours in the past to change HTML file if a project’s status was changed or a new project was added. I planned to put information of projects in a JSON file. Next time, if a project information should be updated or added, what I do is to change the JSON file. There are two JSON files, one for the projects and the other for 100-day challenges.

Thoughts and Emotions: It is a relief. I can record projects that are suitable for beginners in the RSnippets.com. If I learn something new in the future, I can actively think what small projects I can do to practice the knowledge just learned. The idea I have and the projects I made will not be “once then never see it again”. They will benefit people who have frustration during learning like me. FreeCodeCamp inspired me to do so. I made the project with Hugo. Though I did not code a lot for the project, I can more easily understand some concepts because of studying on FreeCodeCamp. Sometimes, the success of projects are not based on latest and shiny technologies but good ideas, using simple tools to achieve them, and marketing them.

Origin &apos;http://127.0.0.1:3000&apos; is therefore not allowed access. I searched on the FreeCodeForum. Students all face this problem. I will read it in tomorrow’s session Thoughts and Emotions: Very difficult. There are 2 parts of my study, one for doing algorithm on FreeCodeCamp, the other for making projects. Both parts are stuck today. According to my previous experience, I need to touch the problems every day and eventually they will be solved. Maybe 1 day, 2 days, or one week.

One of the reason is that I do not know how data in the form is transferred to JavaScript functions and how to style the forms.

In fact, time is also needed to be spent on marketing, publishing to GitHub, writing good README.md files, adding subdomains and so on. If the project I did is suitable for beginners, I will write a post. Writing requires time and energy.

There is a big difference between Udacity and FreeCodeCamp: projects. Projects on FreeCodeCamp requires students to finish complete websites. In the future, you can show your websites to other people. Here are the first two FreeCodeCamp projects made by me: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Each project took several hours to finish. It was hard but doable. (This is the essence of learning.) In the process of doing projects, I learned how to read official documents of Bootstrap and jQuery without effort. FreeCodeCamp did not teach this. I think almost all students will learn it naturally when working on FreeCodeCamp projects. The first two projects on Udacity Project: Mockup to Article Project: Animal Trading Cards (20 minutes) From the title and time suggested, you can see that the projects are a duplicate of other people’s work. Hence, you definitely cannot show them to your friends, coworkers, or future employers. Udacity’s projects are a mix of tutorials and exercise. It will teach students what students will use in the “projects” first, and then ask students to reproduce the example. Do you know that every tutorial on FreeCodeCamp is a mix of tutorials and exercise? But FreeCodeCamp does not treat them as a project. They are just tutorials. With the same amount time spent, you will learn more from FreeCodeCamp than from Udacity. This is the reason I used the strikethrough: Link: Github Repo| Project. No more project will be produced during the study on Udacity. I feel guilty of counting the Udacity project into the challenge. Usually, I study tutorials for an hour and code for an hour every day. Solution: Count anything on Udacity into the tutorial part. Continue to do FreeCodeCamp projects.

Thoughts and Emotions: Big progression on Wikipedia Viewer! This was the second time that I felt I can not know how to code. I would not implement it forever. Persisting on working for one hour a day controls the level of stress. If I work more than 3 hours on one project and do not make progress, I won’t be happy to do it again.

It looks like a toy. Its quality is not as good as FreeCodeCamp’s projects. I will not include it in my portfolio page. So far, the fastest progress is the questions from Lesson 12 in the forum. I am studying Lesson 11. I feel relieved. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorials on Udacity for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Do JavaScript part of Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Add JS for search text Day 37: 2018-01-14 SundayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Udacity Tutorial What is JavaScript? Data Types &amp; Variables Part of “Conditionals” Thoughts and Emotions: I made a JavaScript form project before: Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator. I thought I understood how to transfer data from the form to JavaScript code. It is wrong. jQuery used different syntax. I do not know how data is transferred between JavaScript style and $(document).ready(). I used search terms naively to search on Google and did not find good tutorials. FreeCodeCamp tutorials do not teach how to submit the form. It is disappointing. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorials on Udacity for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Do JavaScript part of Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Ask help on the gitter Add JS for search text Day 38: 2018-01-15 MondayLink: pixel art maker Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished “Grow with Google Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev” Thoughts and Emotions: I am procrastinating other stuff and insisted on doing “Grow with Google Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev” the whole day. Then I finished it. Finishing the Udacity course does not give me a feeling of fulfillment. Tomorrow’s plan Rest. I will have a rest for a day. Day 39: 2018-01-16 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Project 5!!! Thoughts and Emotions: I planned to have a day off today. Just now I finished today’s challenge 🤣 The Wikipedia View took me so much time that I lost confidence to finish it. I had difficult in the event of the form. FreeCodeCamp doesn’t provide the related tutorial, and reading a whole jQuery book is daunting. Udacity provided the content luckily. It was in the second half of the course. I was so impatient that I overworked yesterday to learn it. Udacity tutorial and persistence on working one hour per day help me finish another challenging project. What is difficult: Using Bootstrap will make my own css style unpredictable and hard to debug. Adding a verticle line before a block when it is hovered. Blocks not hovered have transparent left borders. 1234567 .search-block&#123; border-left: 10px solid transparent;&#125; .search-block:hover &#123; border-left: 10px solid rgb(212, 99, 44); &#125; Wikipedia API Adding event.preventDefault(); within $(&quot;#form&quot;).submit(function(){}); Fontawesome icon and the text do not in the same line when the window size becomes small. Tomorrow’s plan Have a rest. Day 40: 2018-01-18 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Draw a line graph with Chartjs Thoughts and Emotions: There is no easy way to build a JavaScript graph that can accept users’ input and can be showed online. R has a web app called Shiny App to generate what I want. But it requires back-end server. I do not have a server to run Shiny Apps. It requires me to learn how to code for Shiny Apps. I don’t want to buy a server and to learn it. The solution is to choose a JavaScript framework to draw graphs. Compared with R, all of them are not fast to draw graphs. It always has a trade-off. No perfect solution now. Tomorrow’s plan Continue to draw the line graph with Chartjs Future plan Read tutorials Learn CSS Flexbox in 5 Minutes Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know http://flexboxfroggy.com/ http://cssgridgarden.com/ Day 41: 2018-01-19 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Chose a Hugo theme Edit the Hugo theme Chose a Hexo theme Edit the Hexo theme Thoughts and Emotions: I wanted to build/customize a theme for saving my solution to leetcode algorithm challenges. First, I chose Hugo because of its speed. There is a big drawback that made me gave it up. Hugo will updates automatically when users write posts; it deploys constantly. To achieve this, Hugo saves the contents in the memory. It is the best choice for people who write posts only. It becomes a big pain for developers since Hugo will delay to update if files of themes are changed. I cannot tell immediately whether my code is working or not and have to wait for Hugo for an unknown length of time. Then I tried Hexo. My blog was made from Hexo and I like it very much. After hours of searching, I finally chose hexo-theme-Anisina. I thought it would be quick to edit a mature theme. In fact, I spent the whole day and did not complete. 😰 Tomorrow’s plan Finish editing the theme Day 42: 2018-01-20 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Edited the A-RSnippet theme Thoughts and Emotions: I was a little bit mad at hexo-theme-Anisina. The design is beautiful, but the code is messy. There is a lot of code not used. Based on my experience of choosing WordPress themes, Hexo themes, and Hugo themes for 10 years, you can only know whether a theme is really good or not after trying it. Again, an entire day. Tomorrow’s plan Finish editing the theme Day 43: 2018-01-21 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Edited the A-RSnippet theme Thoughts and Emotions: Oh… I continue adjust the theme. Thanks for having been taking courses on FreeeCodeCamp and Udacity. I can understand more code than before. In the past, I read CSS file and did not understand why the style was not right. Now I figured out that past me would never why because CSS was changed by JavaScript and I knew nothing about JS at that time. Tomorrow’s plan Finish editing the theme Day 44: 2018-01-22 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Edit the A-Rsnippet theme Read around 90 Hexo themes Thoughts and Emotions: Oh… I continue adjust the theme. It is the fourth day. I finally reach a point that the current theme is almost satisfying. I need more appearance design to make it unique before publishing to the official Hexo website. A little bit discouraging. It seems there is more needed to learn to build a blog theme. Hexo can use styl and ejs. Javascript taught by FreeCodeCamp and Udacity is a small portion of the knowledge. Bootstrap used by the theme is version 3, not version 4 that I learned last month. I spent a lot of time on making a navigation bar. It is the hardest part of Bootstrap whatever version it is. The icon of Patreon is provided by fontawesome 5 and not by fontawesome 4. The theme used version 4. Version 4 and 5 are so different that I cannot afford to take more time to transfer. I thought I can finish reading themes today. I overestimated my ability. I overworked for four days. I feel tired. My life is broken. Tomorrow’s plan Read Hex themes Day 45: 2018-01-23 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished reading 184 themes on Hexo Theme page. Thoughts and Emotions: Yesertday: 12 a.m. - 4 a.m. Today: 12 a.m. - 8p.m. I spent 12 hours 😵 (eating time included) to read 184 themes one by one. There are some features I put in my future’s todo list. Some theme authors used their blogs as demo. They are young. A lot of them are in the universities or just graduated. I have to confess that this made me sad. I am older but knew web development less than them. I am preparing to publish it to the Hexo theme page. Hugo has much better list of tags to show the characteristics of themes. I read the list and chose which tag to add 😃 . I was wrapping up the files to release. In the process, there are bugs and inconsistency showing up. It is great. It cannot be finished until I completed the documentation. I thought I can finish submitting the theme. I overestimated my ability. Tomorrow’s plan Write a documentation to be placed in the README.md file on GitHub Move files to the example website folder Build a brand new website to test the example website Upload to GitHub Use Netlify Add a subdomain name Create a patreon page Create a cover photo for the theme Submit the theme to Hexo Google site verification Create a forum Summarize future features After that, I will do data analysis Day 46: 2018-01-24 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Wrote documentation Found more bugs when writing documentation Adjusted the example site Created a Discord Channel Created a Patreon page Connected Patreon to Discord Released a version for the first time!!!! Pulled request to Hexo website This is my first time to pull a request!!! Created a picture for the theme Thoughts and Emotions: During making the theme, I learned ejs practicing CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery writing documentation write a list of pages to test each function thinking about how to maintain a small but not easy open-source project create a community: a forum Users will ask questions in a forum. GitHub issue section is for issues and future features only. get donation: patreon I will charge users based on release, not monthly. I think of one way to organize notes that are impossible to be arranged in the table: create a static generated documentation website. I can access it online and locally. Everybody can see the notes and it reduces the effort for privacy. Now I plan to make 4 websites!!! I will not customize the theme. It is time-consuming. documentation for R packages I learned and used documentation for statistics knowledge. I forgot a lot. document for reading paper. This has been never solved. The new method seems promising. (private) documentation for doing projects log email log data log everyday activity log my thinking I used MarkDown to log email, data, and everyday activity. But it does not seems to be easily read. Becuase the documentation is so long. Most of keywords are the same, and thus it is impossible to search. MarkDown’s table of contents are usually at the beginning of the page for all apps. It is hard to use. Documentation websites provide TOC fixed at sidebar. It can be seen all the time. Tomorrow’s plan Create a forum Create a documentation website for the data analysis project Create a documentation website for R package Create a documentation website for reading paper After that, I will do data analysis. Day 47: 2018-01-25 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Created a forum Thoughts and Emotions: January 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25: 7 days to finish the first version of the Hexo A-RSnippet theme. I searched online and found flarum. It is a forum app that uses PHP. I like discord and NodeBB. Because both of them require cloud server, I have to pay an additional fee if I use them. Luckily, I found a website freeflarum.com that hosts Plarum forum for free. Their business model is to show some ads on the free forums. So far, I do not see any ads and am not sure when and what ads will show. Making open source project is time-consuming. If there is no sustainable business model, most of the good open-source respositories will not update regularly. Tomorrow’s plan Made a Hexo layout for streaming data science multi-language Day 48: 2018-01-27 SaturdayLink: http://yingjiehu.com/archive_streaming_data_science/ Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Live Streaming on twitch Added a new template to show streaming for data science Thoughts and Emotions: I streamed for data science in the afternoon. At night, I planned to stream for one hour, but I talked to several persons and had to talk during coding. The speed of coding is very slow. I did not know whether I will do it or not. I cannot find the bugs during streaming and finished quickly after it. Though I can practice English, the length of time spent concerns me. Tomorrow’s plan Internationalization for A-RSnippet theme Edit templates Create one file for simplified Chinese Check bugs Day 49: 2018-01-28Link: Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Create a post if title is empty Delete website subtitle Thoughts and Emotions: I finished my goal today: add internalization for Hexo A-RSnippet theme. I was streaming while I was coding. Yesterday, I talked along the way. Today I kept quiet and coding. No new followers. It is normal. Tomorrow’s plan[ ] Start freecodecamp Twitchtv JSON API Day 50: 2018-02-02 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 15: Hexo theme A-RSnippet Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Added related post to the theme Started to learn back-end on FreeCodeCamp. Thoughts and Emotions: I do not feel fulfillment to use npm modules to add features to the theme. I feel frustrated. FreeCodeCamp does not teach all JavaScript and AJAX. I need to learn outside. I feel worried about learning books and watching video tutorials without projects. In addition, I do not have time to reading more books. Tomorrow’s plan No plan. Day 51: 2018-02-18 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Made a sample website without backend Added backend Thoughts and Emotions: It is hard. I did it little by little and was happy that I can make it using the knowledge learned from FreeCodeCamp and Hexo. Tomorrow’s plan Add backend Day 52: 2018-02-19 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Added backend Uploaded to GitLab Used Netlify to auto deploy Thoughts and Emotions: I finished the website. Tomorrow’s plan Add backend Day 53: 2018-03-19 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 16: Twitch Streamer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One-hour Javascript algorithm One-hour programming for CSS and HTML of Twitch Streamer project Thoughts and Emotions: It is a one-month rest. It is easy to think if I did not rest for one month, today would be around the 83rd day. Face the truth and restart the challenge. My therapist said it could be a good practice. I was discouraged by the Javascript algorithm problems. Exact Change was hard to solve. It was amazing that I finished today. It remains true that if I work on the front-end projects for an hour every day without depression, in a limited number of days, I can solve the challenging problems. Tomorrow’s plan CSS and HTML of Twitch Streamer project]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Reading Paper (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The supporting project is 100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis) Main Commitment: I will read paper for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-18 Reference: How to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution Rules I will read paper for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReadingPaper and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log12345678910### Day :**Paper: []()****Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-18 Monday ) 7 Days (Day 7: 2018-11-19 Monday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days LOGDay 1: 2017-12-18 MondayPaper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started reading paper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Created powerpoint to represent the paper in tomorrow’s seminar Thoughts and Emotions I delayed this challenge for at least two weeks. 😭 It was my initial motivation to start 100 Days Challenge. Because of procrastination, I started other 3 challenges 😂 100 Days Of Code: Web Development 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R 100 Days Of Japanese And restarted writing in this blog which was abandoned in 2014. Three years have passed. Time flies! During three year, I posted only two posts this February. Thank you for 100 Days Challenge project. I found the way to use the blog with joy. Writing blog posts were suffering, but it is fun to use it to track progress. I add new contents every day even if no new posts are created except 4 posts about challenges. Besides, it helps me practice English writing (I am Chinese). Back to paper, it is a pain to read paper. However, I found myself enjoy creating powerpoints. Better, I copied the small section of paper into note part of slides then read it. This decreases stress to read a paper over 10 pages. Day 2: 2018-01-06Paper: Relaxed Lasso by Nicolai Meinshausen Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started to read paper again. 😂 Thoughts and Emotions I did an experiment. If I begin to do things that have the highest resistance, will I achieve more? Will the stress level go down? Will I be happier? Reading paper is on the top list. Then I did it. I feel a little bit relief. But I postponed it to 5 p.m., and this means I will achieve less than yesterday. Completing less can increase stress level, too. Is there a balance. Tomorrow’s plan Read “Relaxed Lasso” Day 3: 2018-11-12 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 54 minutes Day 4: 2018-11-13 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 19 minutes Day 5: 2018-11-15 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 4 minutes Day 6: 2018-11-16 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 9 minutes Day 7: 2018-11-19 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 15 minutes Day 8: 2018-11-21 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 53 minutes Day 9: 2018-11-30 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read 20 minutes Day 10: 2018-12-03 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read paper and write proposal 2 hours]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[It is a correct choice to buy Mac Pro!]]></title>
    <url>%2Fits-a-correct-choice-to-buy-mac-pro%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I usually saw some tutorials in youtube about how to use softwares. There is a high probability that people in the video used Mac to teach how to program. In the past, I feel doubt that why it happened. Last year, in the thanksgiving’s shopping season ($150 off), I decided to buy 13 inch, not too big and heavy, not too small. In the store, it was easy for me to confuse which one to buy, Mac Pro or Mac Air. The employee in the NYU Mac store said price performance ratio was better. She recommended that it was better to buy Mac Air if Mac was my secondary computer. Finally, I made the decision to buy Mac Pro 13 inch because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger. Last week, my experience told me that it is one of the most valuable items purchased last year. I did one problem about kernel smoothing method and used guassian kernel. The training data set was big with over 7000 observations and 56 predictors. All the predictors had to be used to generate guassian kernals for each observation in test data. Then I programmed the process to create guassian kernals. For each test data, it took about 3 minutes to generate the wights. I felt it was too slow then run the same program in Lenovo Thinkpad T420. It cost third times time. One of my classmates used Mac Air to program, she could not know when the program would stop but the same program was run in Mac Pro in several seconds. Big difference! A computer with faster CPU is very important. It recalled me the time last semester. A lot of programming were required for bayesian class. Some programs were slow. If I used Mac Pro at that time, less time would be put in my homework and I did not need to stay up every week!]]></content>

    <url>%2FHow-long-to-write-a-book%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How long to write a book? No correct answer to this question. My sensibility always admire people who can write the book as quickly as possible because the speed implies that they have high productivity and other abilities. My intellects know my sensibility is wrong. How to marry intellects and sensibility? I do not have answer to this question, either. One thing can be confirmed that good books take time. How long? Several years. Eric Novik planned to write a book recently, 8 chapter and over 300 pages. He asked Prof. Gelman: The work seems overwhelming. I always wondered how you manage to produce such high volume of high quality content. What’s the secret?Prof. Gelman replied in his blog:The first secret is, I wouldn’t try to write a book in 6 to 8 months. The first edition of Bayesian Data Analysis took several years. Each new edition took awhile too. So if “long and arduous” to you means “6 to 8 months,” I think your time management skills are already much better than mine!]]></content>
